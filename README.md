### More details

[Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) (an open-source reference management software) uses ['groups'](https://www.zotero.org/support/groups) to enabled shared bibliographic libraries. 

GRAPL is a *public, closed membership group*, which means:

- Anyone can view the [group page](https://grapl.grdi-amr.com/) and the metadata (e.g., title, authors, abstracts) associated with the library.
- Group members can access full-text .PDFs and work with the library directly in the Zotero desktop app.
