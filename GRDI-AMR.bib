  abstract = {This study aimed to compare antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in extended-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant and generic Escherichia coli from a One Health continuum of the beef production system in Alberta, Canada. A total of 705 extended-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant E. coli (ESCr) were obtained from: cattle feces (CFeces, n = 382), catch basins (CBasins, n = 137), surrounding streams (SStreams, n = 59), beef processing plants (BProcessing, n = 4), municipal sewage (MSewage; n = 98) and human clinical specimens (CHumans, n = 25). Generic isolates (663) included: CFeces (n = 142), CBasins (n = 185), SStreams (n = 81), BProcessing (n = 159) and MSewage (n = 96). All isolates were screened for antimicrobial susceptibility to 9 antimicrobials and two clavulanic acid combinations. In ESCr, oxytetracycline (87.7\%), ampicillin (84.4\%) and streptomycin (73.8\%) resistance phenotypes were the most common, with source influencing AMR prevalence (p {$<$} 0.001). In generic E. coli, oxytetracycline (51.1\%), streptomycin (22.6\%), ampicillin (22.5\%) and sulfisoxazole (14.3\%) resistance were most common. Overall, 88.8\% of ESCr, and 26.7\% of generic isolates exhibited multi-drug resistance (MDR). MDR in ESCr was high from all sources: CFeces (97.1\%), MSewage (96.9\%), CHumans (96\%), BProcessing (100\%), CBasins (70.5\%) and SStreams (61.4\%). MDR in generic E. coli was lower with CFeces (45.1\%), CBasins (34.6\%), SStreams (23.5\%), MSewage (13.6\%) and BProcessing (10.7\%). ESBL phenotypes were confirmed in 24.7\% (n = 174) ESCr and 0.6\% of generic E. coli. Prevalence of bla genes in ESCr were blaCTXM (30.1\%), blaCTXM-1 (21.6\%), blaTEM (20\%), blaCTXM-9 (7.9\%), blaOXA (3.0\%), blaCTXM-2 (6.4\%), blaSHV (1.4\%) and AmpC {$\beta$}-lactamase blaCMY (81.3\%). The lower AMR in ESCr from SStreams and BProcessing and higher AMR in CHumans and CFeces likely reflects antimicrobial use in these environments. Although MDR levels were higher in ESCr as compared to generic E. coli, AMR to the same antimicrobials ranked high in both ESCr and generic E. coli sub-populations. This suggests that both sub-populations reflect similar AMR trends and are equally useful for AMR surveillance. Considering that MDR ESCr MSewage isolates were obtained without enrichment, while those from CFeces were obtained with enrichment, MSewage may serve as a hot spot for MDR emergence and dissemination.},

  abstract = {Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has important implications for the continued use of antibiotics to control infectious diseases in both beef cattle and humans. AMR along the One Health continuum of the beef production system is largely unknown. Here, whole genomes of presumptive extended-spectrum {$\beta$}-lactamase E. coli (ESBL-EC) from cattle feces (n = 40), feedlot catch basins (n = 42), surrounding streams (n = 21), a beef processing plant (n = 4), municipal sewage (n = 30), and clinical patients (n = 25) are described. ESBL-EC were isolated from ceftriaxone selective plates and subcultured on ampicillin selective plates. Agreement of genotype-phenotype prediction of AMR ranged from 93.2\% for ampicillin to 100\% for neomycin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and enrofloxacin resistance. Overall, {$\beta$}-lactam (100\%; blaEC, blaTEM-1, blaSHV, blaOXA, blaCTX-M-), tetracycline (90.1\%; tet(A), tet(B)) and folate synthesis (sul2) antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) were most prevalent. The ARGs tet(C), tet(M), tet(32), blaCTX-M-1, blaCTX-M-14, blaOXA-1, dfrA18, dfrA19, catB3, and catB4 were exclusive to human sources, while blaTEM-150, blaSHV-11--12, dfrA12, cmlA1, and cmlA5 were exclusive to beef cattle sources. Frequently encountered virulence factors across all sources included adhesion and type II and III secretion systems, while IncFIB(AP001918) and IncFII plasmids were also common. Specificity and prevalence of ARGs between cattle-sourced and human-sourced presumptive ESBL-EC likely reflect differences in antimicrobial use in cattle and humans. Comparative genomics revealed phylogenetically distinct clusters for isolates from human vs. cattle sources, implying that human infections caused by ESBL-EC in this region might not originate from beef production sources.},

  abstract = {Summary                            In livestock production, antibiotics are used to promote animal growth, control infections and thereby increase profitability. This practice has led to the emergence of multiresistant bacteria such as               Salmonella               , of which some serovars are disseminated in the environment. The objective of this study is to evaluate microcin J25 as an inhibitor of               Salmonella enterica               serovars of various origins including human, livestock and food. Among the 116 isolates tested, 37 (31.8\%) were found resistant to at least one antibiotic, and 28 were multiresistant with 19 expressing the penta-resistant phenotype ACSSuT. Microcin J25 inhibited all isolates, with minimal inhibitory concentration values ranging from 0.06\,{$\mu$}g/ml (28.4\,nM) to 400\,{$\mu$}g/ml (189\,{$\mu$}M). Interestingly, no cross-resistance was found between microcin J25 and antibiotics. Multiple sequence alignments of genes encoding for the different proteins involved in the recognition and transport of microcin J25 showed that only ferric-hydroxamate uptake is an essential determinant for susceptibility of               S               .               enterica               to microcin J25. Examination of               Salmonella               strains exposed to microcin J25 by transmission electronic microscopy showed for the first-time involvement of a pore formation mechanism. Microcin J25 was a strong inhibitor of several multiresistant isolates of               Salmonella               and may have a great potential as an alternative to antibiotics.},

Methods: WGS using short-read and long-read methods was used to characterize the isolates. Bioinformatic analysis was used to identify the potential gene encoding a carbapenemase. Cloning, antimicrobial susceptibility testing and biochemical and phenotypic characterization were used to determine metallo-enzyme activity. Single-nucleotide variant (SNV) typing was used to determine strain relatedness. Conjugation experiments were used to determine transmissibility of the novel carbapenemase-encoding gene. Results: WGS analysis revealed a novel class B b-lactamase gene, blaCAM-1 (Central Alberta Metallo-b-lactamase), located in a 73 kb integrative element, named IMEPaCAM-1, in the chromosome of four clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa. The cloned blaCAM-1 gene conferred carbapenem resistance to Escherichia coli TOP10. The four isolates, which were all closely related, were from three patients, all of whom spent time in the same hospital in 2008 and/or 2009. IMEPaCAM-1 could not be transferred by conjugation. Conclusions: A novel metallo-enzyme, CAM-1, is encoded on an integrative element, IMEPaCAM-1, located in the chromosome of clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa. No additional isolates harbouring CAM-1 have been identified in Alberta since 2007.},

  abstract = {Objectives: Globally there is an increased prevalence of carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter spp. (CRAs) and carbapenemase-producing Acinetobacter spp. (CPAs) in the hospital setting. This increase prompted the Canadian Nosocomial Infection Surveillance Program (CNISP) to conduct surveillance of CRA colonizations and infections identified from patients in CNISP-participating hospitals between 2010 and 2016. Methods: Participating acute care facilities across Canada submitted CRAs from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2016. Patient data were collected from medical records using a standardized questionnaire. WGS was conducted on all CRAs and data underwent single nucleotide variant analysis, resistance gene detection and MLST. Results: The 7 year incidence rate of CRA was 0.02 per 10 000 patient days and 0.015 per 1000 admissions, with no significant increase observed over the surveillance period (P . 0.73). Ninety-four CRA isolates were collected from 58 hospitals, of which 93 (98.9\%) were CPA. Carbapenemase OXA-235 group (48.4\%) was the most common due to two separate clusters, followed by the OXA-23 group (41.9\%). Patients with a travel history were associated with 38.8\% of CRA cases. The all-cause 30 day mortality rate for infected cases was 24.4 per 100 CRA cases. Colistin was the most active antimicrobial agent (95.8\% susceptibility). Conclusions: CRA remains uncommon in Canadian hospitals and the incidence did not increase from 2010 to 2016. Almost half of the cases were from two clusters harbouring OXA-235-group enzymes. Previous medical treatment during travel outside of Canada was common.},

  abstract = {Biosolids that are applied to agricultural soil as an organic fertilizer are frequently contaminated with pharmaceutical residues that have persisted during wastewater treatment and partitioned into the organic phase. Macrolide antibiotics, which serve as a critically important human medicine, have been detected within biosolids. To determine the impacts of macrolide antibiotics on soil bacteria, every year for a decade, a series of replicated field plots received an application of a mixture of erythromycin, clarithromycin, and azithromycin at a realistic (0.1 mg kg soil21) or an unrealistically high (10 mg kg soil21) dose or were left untreated. The effects of repeated antibiotic exposure on the soil bacterial community, resistome, mobilome, and integron gene cassette content were evaluated by 16S rRNA and integron gene cassette amplicon sequencing, as well as whole-metagenome sequencing. At the unrealistically high dose, the overall diversity of the resistome and mobilome was altered, as 21 clinically important antibiotic resistance genes predicted to encode resistance to 10 different antibiotic drug classes were increased and 20 mobile genetic element variants (tnpA, intI1, tnpAN, and IS91) were increased. In contrast, at the realistic dose, no effect was observed on the overall diversity of the soil bacterial community, resistome, mobilome, or integron gene cassette-carrying genes. Overall, these results suggest that macrolide antibiotics entrained into soil at concentrations anticipated with biosolid applications would not result in major changes to these endpoints.},

One of the first steps in the guidelines is to compile a risk profile, which provides the current state of knowledge regarding a food safety issue, describes risk management options and recommends next steps. In Canada, ceftiofur/ceftriaxone-resistant Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Heidelberg from poultry was identified as an antimicrobial resistance (AMR) food safety issue. The first objective of this article was to contextualise this food safety issue, using the risk profile format of the Codex Guidelines. A second objective was to evaluate the applicability of the Codex Guidelines. This risk profile indicated that ceftiofur/ceftriaxoneresistant S. Heidelberg (CSH) was commonly isolated from poultry and was associated with severe disease in humans. Ceftiofur use in poultry hatcheries temporally mirrored the prevalence of CSH from poultry meat at retail and from people with salmonellosis. The evidence was sufficient to indicate the need for risk management options, such as restricting the use of ceftiofur in poultry. The Codex Guidelines provided a useful approach to summarise data for decision-makers to evaluate an AMR food safety issue.},

Of note, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter spp. carried larger proportions of the quinolone resistance gene qnrS and some clinically relevant beta-lactam resistance genes in comparison to Salmonella and Escherichia coli. The prevalence of mec in S. aureus did not significantly differ between meat/poultry and multi-product sources relative to clinical sources, whereas this resistance was rare in isolates from dairy sources. The proportion of biocide resistance in Bacillus and Escherichia was significantly higher in clinical isolates compared to many foodborne sources but significantly lower in clinical Listeria compared to foodborne Listeria. This work exposes the gaps in current publicly available sequence data repositories, which are largely composed of clinical isolates and are biased towards specific highly abundant pathogenic species. We also highlight the importance of requiring and curating metadata on sequence submission to not only ensure correct information and data interpretation but also foster efficient analysis, sharing, and collaboration. To effectively monitor resistance carriage in food production, additional work on sequencing and characterizing AMR carriage in common commensal foodborne bacteria is critical.},

  abstract = {Bacterial carbapenem resistance is a major public health concern since these antimicrobials are often the last resort to treat serious human infections. To evaluate methodologies for detection of carbapenem resistance, carbapenem-tolerant bacteria were isolated from wastewater treatment plants in Toronto, Ottawa, and Arnprior, Ontario. A total of 135 carbapenem-tolerant bacteria were recovered. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) indicated the presence of carbapenem hydrolysing enzymes KPC ( n = 10), GES ( n = 5), VIM ( n = 7), and IMP ( n = 1), and {$\beta$}-lactamases TEM ( n = 7), PER ( n = 1), and OXA-variants ( n = 16). A subset of 46 isolates were sequenced and analysed using ResFinder and CARD-RGI. Both programs detected carbapenem resistance genes in 35 sequenced isolates and antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) conferring resistance to multiple class of other antibiotics. Where {$\beta$}-lactamase resistance genes were not initially identified, lowering the thresholds for ARG detection enabled identification of closely related {$\beta$}-lactamases. However, no known carbapenem resistance genes were found in seven sequenced Pseudomonas spp. isolates. Also of note was a multi-drug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae isolate from Ottawa, which harboured resistance to seven antimicrobial classes including {$\beta$}-lactams. These results highlight the diversity of genes encoding carbapenem resistance in Ontario and the utility of whole genome sequencing over PCR for ARG detection where resistance may result from an assortment of genes.},

We performed whole genome sequencing analyses of 1,279 well-characterized L. monocytogenes isolates from various foods and food manufacturing environments and identified the bcrABC gene cassette associated with BC resistance in 531 (41.5\%) isolates. The bcrABC cassette was significantly associated with L. monocytogenes isolates belonging to clonal complex (CC) 321, CC155, CC204, and CC199, which are among the 10 most prevalent genotypes recovered from foods and food production environments. All but 1 of the 177 CC321 isolates harbored the bcrABC cassette. In addition, 384 (38.6\%) of the 994 isolates recovered from foods representing 67 different CCs and 119 (59.2\%) of isolates from food manufacturing environmental samples representing 26 different CCs were found to harbor the intact bcrABC cassette. A representative set of 69 isolates with and without bcrABC was assayed for the ability to grow in the presence of BC, and 34 of 35 isolates harboring the bcrABC cassette exhibited MICs of !10 {$\mu$}g/mL BC. Determination of bcrABC in isolates could be achieved using both PCR and whole genome sequencing techniques, providing food testing laboratories with options for the characterization of isolates. The ability to determine markers of quaternary ammonium compound resistance such as bcrABC and epidemiologic lineage may provide risk managers with a tool to assess the potential for persistent contamination of the food manufacturing environment and the need for more targeted surveillance to ensure the efficacy of mitigation actions.},

To evaluate the performance of existing bioinformatic tools for in silico prediction of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and serotypes of Salmonella enterica, WGS-based genotype predictions were compared with the results of traditional phenotyping assays. A total of 111 S. enterica isolates recovered from a Canadian baseline study on broiler chicken conducted in 20122013 were selected based on phenotypic resistance to 15 different antibiotics and isolates were subjected to WGS. Both SeqSero2 and SISTR accurately determined S. enterica serotypes, with full matches to laboratory results for 87.4 and 89.2\% of isolates, respectively, and partial matches for the remaining isolates. Antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) were identified using several bioinformatics tools including the Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database -- Resistance Gene Identifier (CARDRGI), Center for Genomic Epidemiology (CGE) ResFinder web tool, Short Read Sequence Typing for Bacterial Pathogens (SRST2 v 0.2.0), and k-mer alignment method (KMA v 1.17). All ARG identification tools had {$\geq$} 99\% accuracy for predicting resistance to all antibiotics tested except streptomycin (accuracy 94.6\%). Evaluation of ARG detection in assembled versus raw-read WGS data found minimal observable differences that were gene- and coverage- dependent. Where initial phenotypic results indicated isolates were sensitive, yet ARGs were detected, repeat AMR testing corrected discrepancies. All tools failed to find resistance-determining genes for one gentamicinand two streptomycin-resistant isolates. Further investigation found a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the nuoF coding region of one of the isolates which may be responsible for the observed streptomycin-resistant phenotype. Overall, WGS-based predictions of AMR and serotype were highly concordant with phenotype determination regardless of computational approach used.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT With the pressure to reduce antibiotics use in poultry production, cost-effective alternative products need to be developed to enhance the bird's immunity. The present study evaluated the efficacy of cranberry fruit by-products to modulate immunity in broiler chickens. Broiler Cobb 500 chicks were fed a control basal diet, basal diet supplemented with bacitracin (BACI, 55 ppm), cranberry pomace at 1\% and 2\% (CP2), or cranberry pomace ethanolic extract at 150 and 300 ppm (COH300) for 30 d. Blood sera were analyzed at days 21 and 28 of age for Ig levels by ELISA. The innate and adaptive immune-related gene expression levels in the liver and bursa of Fabricius were investigated at 21 d of age by quantitative polymerase chain reaction arrays. At day 21, the highest IgY level was found in the blood serum of the CP2-fed birds. In the liver, 13 of the 22 differentially expressed genes were downregulated across all treatments compared with the control. Expression of genes belonging to innate immunity such as caspase 1 apoptosis--related cysteine peptidase, chemokine receptor 5, interferon gamma, myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88, and Toll-like receptor 3 were significantly downregulated mainly in BACI- and COH300-fed birds. In the bursa, 5 of 9 genes associated with the innate immunity were differentially expressed. The expression of anti-inflammatory IL-10 gene was upregulated in all treatment groups in bursa compared with the control. The expression of transferrin gene was significantly upregulated in livers of birds fed COH300 and in bursa of birds fed BACI, indicating feeding practices and organdependant modulation of this gene in broiler. Overall results of this study showed that cranberry product feed supplementation modulated the innate immune and suppressed proinflammatory cytokines in broilers, providing a platform for future investigations to develop berry products in poultry feeding.},

This study investigated the antimicrobial activities of ceftriaxone (AXO) and cranberry pomace extracts (CRAN) alone or in combination (CC) against multidrug-resistant (MDR) ExPEC from broiler. The growth-inhibitory activity of CRAN and synergy tests by a checkerboard method were determined in cation-adjusted Mueller--Hinton broth (CAMHB). The transcriptomic profile of the MDR               E. coli               O7:H18 (ST38) grown in CAMHB supplemented with sub-inhibitory concertation of CRAN and AXO alone or in combination was obtained by RNA-seq. The MIC of CRAN for all isolates was 16 mg/mL. An additive activity was observed between 4 mg/mL of CRAN and 4 {$\mu$}g/mL of AXO. Compared to the control, the transcriptomic analysis revealed that 4 mg/ml of (1/4MIC) CRAN and its combination with 4 {$\mu$}g/mL of (1/8MIC) AXO (CC) exposures resulted in 727 and 712 differentially expressed genes, respectively (false discovery rate \&lt; 0.001 and log               2               -fold change \&gt; 2), in the studied               E. coli               .

Most importantly, 1/4MIC of CRAN or CC downregulated the {$\beta$}-lactamase               bla               CMY-2               and efflux pump including               tolC, mdtEIJ, gadEW               , and their regulator gene               evgS               , while upregulating the cysteine biosynthesis and oxidative stress-related regulatory genes including               cys, dmlA, sbp, nrdGHI, soxSR               , and               rpoH               .

The downregulation of outer membrane protein genes that control permeability barriers, along with different antimicrobial resistance genes, demonstrates that CRAN may have the unique potential to enhance the antimicrobial activities of third-generation cephalosporins such as AXO against MDR               E. coli               .},

We investigated the antimicrobial activity of an ethanolic extract (\#FC111-1) prepared from cranberry pomace against Listeria spp. Many polyphenolics were identified in this extract which could be responsible for growth-inhibitory effects against 12 Listeria strains including L. monocytogenes. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of \#FC111-1 determined in cation adjusted Muller Hinton broth (CAMHB) was approximately 2 mg/mL for 11 (91.7\%) of these strains. The inclusion of 2--8 mg/mL (1--4 {\texttimes} MIC) of \#FC111-1 decreased ({$>$} 3 log10) viable bacterial cells of all Listeria strains in CAMHB over a 24 h period, while dose-dependently reducing bacterial salt tolerance, bacterial bile-salt hydrolase activity, bacterial biofilm formation capacity, and increasing cell-membrane permeability. The \#FC1111 extract (0.4 and 0.8\% concentrations) had no effect on L. monocytogenes survival in a cooked chicken-breast meat model, highlighting the influence of protein-rich matrices on antibacterial activity and the need to consider the role of food composition when using extracts or polyphenolics from cranberry fruits to improve food-safety.},

  abstract = {Background:{\enspace} Sequence-based methods for the detection of bacteria such as 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and metagenomics can provide a comprehensive view of the bacterial microbiome of food. These methods rely on the detection of gene sequences to indicate the presence of viable bacteria. This indirect form of detection can be prone to experimental artefacts. Sample handling and processing are key sources of variation that require standard approaches. Extracting sufficient quantities of high quality DNA from food matrices is challenging because target bacterial species are usually minor components of the microbiota and foods contain an array of compounds that are inhibitory to downstream DNA applications. Here, three DNA extraction methods are compared for their ability to extract high quality bacterial DNA from retail chicken breast rinses, with or without enrichment. Method performance was assessed by comparing ease of use, DNA yield, DNA quality, PCR amplicon yield, and the detection of bacterial taxa by 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. Results:{\enspace} All three DNA extraction methods yielded DNA of sufficient quantity and quality to perform quantitative PCR and 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. The extraction methods differed in ease of use, with the two commercial kits (PowerFood, PowerSoil) offering considerable time and cost savings over a hybrid method that used laboratory reagents for lysis and commercial column based kits for further purification. Bacterial richness as determined by 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing was similar across the three DNA extraction methods. However, differences were noted in the relative abundance of bacterial taxa, with significantly higher abundance of Gram-positive genera detected in the DNA samples prepared using the PowerFood DNA extraction kit. Conclusion:{\enspace} The choice of DNA extraction method can affect the detection of bacterial taxa by 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing in chicken meat rinses. Investigators should be aware of this procedural bias and select methods that are fit for the purposes of their investigation.},

  abstract = {Metagenomics analysis of foods has the potential to provide comprehensive data on the presence and prevalence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes in the microbiome of foods. However, AMR genes are generally present in low abundance compared to other bacterial genes in the food microbiome and consequently require multiple rounds of in-depth sequencing for detection. Here, a metagenomics approach, using bait-capture probes targeting antimicrobial resistance and plasmid genes, is used to characterize the resistome and plasmidome of retail beef, chicken, oyster, shrimp, and veal enrichment cultures (               n               \,=\,15). Compared to total shotgun metagenomics, bait-capture required approximately 40-fold fewer sequence reads to detect twice the number of AMR gene classes, AMR gene families, and plasmid genes across all sample types. For the detection of critically important extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) genes the bait capture method had a higher overall positivity rate (44\%) compared to shotgun metagenomics (26\%), and a culture-based method (29\%). Overall, the results support the use of bait-capture for the identification of low abundance genes such as AMR genes from food samples.},

  abstract = {The effects of sub-minimum inhibitory concentrations (sub-MICs) of antibiotics on aquatic environments is not yet fully understood. Here, we explore these effects by employing a replicated microcosm system fed with river water where biofilm communities were continuously exposed over an eight-week period to sub-MIC exposure (1/10, 1/50, and 1/100 MIC) to a mix of common antibiotics (ciprofloxacin, streptomycin, and oxytetracycline). Biofilms were examined using a structure--function approach entailing microscopy and metagenomic techniques, revealing details on the microbiome, resistome, virulome, and functional prediction. A comparison of three commonly used microbiome and resistome databases was also performed. Differences in biofilm architecture were observed between sub-MIC antibiotic treatments, with an overall reduction of extracellular polymeric substances and autotroph (algal and cyanobacteria) and protozoan biomass, particularly at the 1/10 sub-MIC condition. While metagenomic analyses demonstrated that microbial diversity was lowest at the sub-MIC 1/10 antibiotic treatment, resistome diversity was highest at sub-MIC 1/50. This study also notes the importance of benchmarking analysis tools and careful selection of reference databases, given the disparity in detected antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) identity and abundance across methods. Ultimately, the most detected ARGs in sub-MICs exposed biofilms were those that conferred resistance to aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, {$\beta$}-lactams, sulfonamides, and trimethoprim. Co-occurrence of microbiome and resistome features consistently showed a relationship between Proteobacteria genera and aminoglycoside ARGs. Our results support the hypothesis that constant exposure to sub-MICs antibiotics facilitate the transmission and promote prevalence of antibiotic resistance in riverine biofilms communities, and additionally shift overall microbial community metabolic function.},

  abstract = {Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is continuing to grow across the world. Though often thought of as a mostly public health issue, AMR is also a major agricultural and environmental problem. As such, many researchers refer to it as the preeminent One Health issue. Aerial transport of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria via bioaerosols is still poorly understood. Recent work has highlighted the presence of antibiotic resistance genes in bioaerosols. Emissions of AMR bacteria and genes have been detected from various sources, including wastewater treatment plants, hospitals, and agricultural practices; however, their impacts on the broader environment are poorly understood. Contextualizing the roles of bioaerosols in the dissemination of AMR necessitates a multidisciplinary approach. Environmental factors, industrial and medical practices, as well as ecological principles influence the aerial dissemination of resistant bacteria. This article introduces an ongoing project assessing the presence and fate of AMR in bioaerosols across Canada. Its various sub-studies include the assessment of the emissions of antibiotic resistance genes from many agricultural practices, their long-distance transport, new integrative methods of assessment, and the creation of dissemination models over short and long distances. Results from sub-studies are beginning to be published. Consequently, this paper explains the background behind the development of the various sub-studies and highlight their shared aspects.},

Globally, antimicrobial use (AMU) in food-producing animals is under increasing scrutiny due to its potential to promote antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Historically, comprehensive Canadian data related to the types of antimicrobial drugs used, extent of use, common indicators of use and the demographics of the cattle populations receiving antimicrobial drugs have been limited, in part due to segmentation in the cattle industry and fragmentation of the drug distribution system. Appropriate AMU estimates are required to understand AMU practices, to interpret AMR levels and patterns, to meaningfully assess associated public health risks, and to inform stewardship activities. The Canadian beef cattle industry has a long history of collaboration in AMU and AMR research. Prior research projects identified both opportunities and challenges in the collection of AMU data. Cornerstone projects provided insight into the complexity of collecting AMU data in Canada's feedlot sector. This paper will discuss how the lessons learned from past work have contributed to the formation of a Canadian fed-cattle antimicrobial surveillance program that was initiated in 2019. This important surveillance program will allow feedlot cattle AMU to improve management decisions and support AMU best practices in the evolving Canadian AMR landscape.},

The review identified 26 studies that yielded many case reports, a lack of recent literature and a lack of Canadian data. Studies reported 26 different BOI measures and the most common were hospitalisation, diarrhoea, fever and duration of illness. There were mixed results as BOI measures reported in literature were inconsistently defined and there were limited comparisons between resistant and susceptible infections. This presents a challenge when attempting to assess the magnitude of the BOI due to FQR Campylobacter spp., highlighting the need for more research in this area.},

While there are currently few applications for such processing-residues in poultry nutrition, there are many potential opportunities for the development of sustainable and value-added products. The aim of the current work was to investigate the effect(s) of four consecutive weeks of cranberry pomace (CBP) feeding on blood serum metabolic profiles and the cecal microbiota of pasture-raised broiler chickens. Six hundred day-old Cobb 500 broiler chicks were divided into three groups: one group receiving the basal diet, and two groups each receiving the basal diet supplemented with either 1 or 2\% of CBP. Blood and cecal samples were collected from the birds before, during, and after the treatment over a period of 64 days for biochemical and 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis, respectively. The detailed analysis of CBP (and formulated final feed) indicated its content in essential amino- and fatty acids in addition to its richness in dietary fibers. Incorporating the pomace in feed induced a dichotomous response in broilers, with short-term improvements in blood-serum iron and cholesterol levels coupled with long-term modulation of cecal microbiota characterized by an increase in beneficial bacterial taxa (including Bifidobacterium, unclassified\_Rikenellaceae, and Faecalibacterium) while decreasing the presence of undesirable ones (unclassified\_Synergistaceae and Desulfovibrio, and unclassified\_Fusobacteriaceae). Overall, the outcome of this study suggests the possibility of using organic CBP as a feed supplement with potential ability to positively influence blood metabolites and gut microbial community composition in pasture-raised broiler chickens.},

Here, we use sediment microcosms to assess the influence of OM, EMB, and OTC on benthic bacterial communities. Microcosms consisted of mud or sand sediments enriched with OM (fish and feed wastes) and spiked with EMB and OTC at environmentally-relevant concentrations. Samples were collected from initial matrices at the initiation of the trial and after 110 days for 16 S rRNA gene sequencing of the V3-V4 region and microbiome profiling. The addition of OM in both mud and sand sediments reduced alpha diversities; for example, an average of 1106 amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) were detected in mud with no OM addition, while only 729 and 596 ASVs were detected in mud with low OM and high OM, respectively. Sediments enriched with OM had higher relative abundances of Spirochaetota, Firmicutes, and Bacteroidota. For instance, Spi\- rochaetota were detected in sediments with no OM with a relative abundance range of 0.01--1.2\%, while in sediments enriched with OM relative abundance varied from 0.16\% to 26.1\%. In contrast, the addition of EMB (60 ng/g) or OTC (150 ng/g) did not result in distinct taxonomic shifts in the bacterial communities compared to un-spiked sediments during the timeline of this experiment. EMB and OTC concentrations may have been below effective inhibitor concentrations for taxa in these communities; further work should explore gene content and the presence of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in sediment-dwelling bacteria.},

This study compiles patterns of antibiotic and antiparasitic drug usage from 2016 to 2021 in British Columbia, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, and Nova Scotia (Canada) and compares them internationally. There is an overall reduction in rates of antibiotic use per fish produced in Canadian aquaculture sites from 2016 to 2021. Compared to other salmon-producing countries, Canadian antibiotic rates per tonne of fish are lower than in Chile, but higher, on average, than in Norway and Scotland. Florfenicol (FLO) and oxytetracycline (OTC) are the prevalent antibiotics used in most salmon-producing countries, including Canada. We also note that {$<$}30\% of sites used two drugs per year and {$<$}18\% of sites used three drugs, with most of these sites using one antibiotic and one antiparasitic. There is an increase in FLO and a decrease use in OTC use in Canada, which could be positive environmentally considering FLO's lower dose and environmental persistence. The east and west coasts show comparable antibiotic rates, with an average rate of 78 mg/kg in BC and 76 mg/kg in the Atlantic provinces; however, they have differences in the type of antibiotic (average use of OTC: BC 38 mg/kg vs. Atlantic 214 mg/kg; average use of FLO: BC 40 mg/kg vs. Atlantic 10 mg/kg). Other distinctions between coasts include variation in the timing of treatments, with seasonal use in the Atlantic provinces (May--November) and year-round use in BC. This pattern is likely influenced by differences in water temperature and, subsequently, potential susceptibility to aquatic diseases. Disease prevalence and veterinarian choice/preferred treatments are factors that, we hypothesize, may impact treatment choice; however, additional information is required to adequately comment on this point. This data compilation includes spatial descriptions that could be used for area prioritization in future studies.},

Perhaps the most well-established strategies are flock and herd management practices to mitigate disease introduction and spread, and, subsequently, reduce the need for antibiotic use. While vaccines in food animal production have been used to prevent both bacterial and viral diseases, but historically, most vaccines have targeted viral diseases. Though vaccines against viral diseases can help reduce the need for antibiotic use by controlling the spread of secondary bacterial infections, more recent vaccines under development specifically target bacteria. New developments in selecting and potentially tailoring bacteriophages provide a promising avenue for controlling pathogenic bacteria without the need for traditional small-molecule antibiotics. In this article we discuss these established and emerging strategies, which are anticipated to reduce the reliance on antibiotics in food animal production and should reduce the prevalence and transmission to humans of antimicrobial resistant bacteria from these systems.},

Biosolids, a product of wastewater treatment process, have been used as fertilizers in agriculture globally and have also been considered as a potential source of pathogens and ARGs for horizontal transfer across various environments. This study characterized antibiotic resistomes and microbiota in 24 biosolids samples collected from two Canadian waste water treatment plants in different cities in 2009 and 2019. The ARGs were detected using a qPCR array kit, and microbiota was analyzed using 16S ribosomal RNA gene amplicon sequencing. Furthermore, correlation analysis of ARG abundance and bacterial genera abundance was explored to predict potential hosts of ARGs. Seventy-one of 84 ARGs were detected in at least one or more samples with 12 ARGs being detected in all samples. Antibiotic resistomes did not show a statistically significant distinction between different collection years, sites, or year and site combined in principle coordinate analysis. The microbiota communities were significantly different between samples collected in different years, sites, or year and site combined. In total 34 phyla were detected with 13 genera among the top three phyla were typically related to the human gut microbiota and seven of them showing strong correlation with ARGs related to aminoglycoside and beta-lactam resistance. This study provides valuable baseline information and consistent trend on ARGs and bacterial communities in biosolid fertilizers in Canada, indicating that the biosolid fertilizer could potentially be a source of ARGs in the agricultural soils and may leading to potential contamination of plant-based food chains.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT Essential oils (EOs) have been considered as an alternative to antibiotics for animal production. In the current study, 4 trials were conducted on a commercial broiler farm to investigate the effects of dietary supplementation of an encapsulated cinnamon EO product (NE-OFF) on the bird growth performance, gut health, and gene expression in the ileum, spleen, and liver relating to the host response to heat and other stresses, including potential NE challenge. In each trial, approximately 30,000 Cobb or Ross broilers were randomly allocated to 4 treatments: a raised without antibiotics (RWA) commercial diet as positive control, an adjusted RWA commercial diet as negative control, and the negative control diet supplemented with 2 different dosages of NE-OFF, which was added during feed pelleting. Although the final average body weight did not differ significantly among treatment groups, birds fed NE-OFF had an increased ratio of villus height and crypt depth in the jejunum, and reduced fecal oocyst counts. Trial 2 was conducted in the summer and had a necrotic enteritis (NE) outbreak. The supplementation of NE-OFF reduced the NE incidence and bird mortality. The samples from Trial 2 were hence selected for the analyses of Clostridium perfringens and NetB toxin gene abundance in the ileum, and host responses. The C. perfringens population appeared to be positively correlated with the NetB gene abundance. The gene expression analysis suggested that NE-OFF supplementation improved nutrient absorption and transportation as well as antioxidant activities to help the birds against stress. These on-farm trial results support the hypothesis that the use of NE-OFF as a feed additive can improve bird gut health and performance in commercial broiler production, especially for preventing NE outbreaks when birds are under stress.},

Design: Retrospective chart review of patients identified as having ST1478 VRE bloodstream infection. Setting: Canadian hospitals that participate in the Canadian Nosocomial Infection Surveillance Program (CNISP). Methods: From 2013 to 2018, VRE bloodstream isolates collected from participating CNISP hospitals were sent to the National Microbiology Laboratory (NML). ST1478 isolates were identified using multilocus sequence typing, and whole-genome sequencing was performed. Patient characteristics and location data were collected for patients with ST1478 bloodstream infection (BSI). The sequence and patient location information were used to generate clusters of infections and assess for intrahospital and interhospital spread. Results: ST1478 VRE BSI occurred predominantly in a small number of hospitals in central and western Canada. Within these hospitals, infections were clustered on certain wards, and isolates often had {$<$}20 single-nucleotide variants (SNV) differences from one another, suggesting a large component of intrahospital spread. Furthermore, some patients with bloodstream infections were identified as moving from one hospital to another, potentially having led to interhospital spread. Genomic analysis of all isolates revealed close relatedness between isolates at multiple different hospitals ({$<$}20 SNV) not predicted from our epidemiologic data. Conclusions: Both intrahospital and regional interhospital spread have contributed to the emergence of VRE ST1478 infections across Canada. Whole-genome sequencing provides evidence of spread that might be missed with epidemiologic investigation alone.},

No properly designed source attribution studies were identified, but 383 journal articles were considered relevant and were classified into eight subcategories and discussed in the context of four streams of evidence: prevalence data, epidemiological studies, outbreak investigations and human health impact estimates. There was sufficient evidence to conclude that AMR genes, whether present in pathogenic or nonpathogenic bacteria, constitute a foodborne hazard. The level of consumer risk owing to this hazard cannot be accurately estimated based on the data summarized here. Key gaps in the literature are noted.},

Food or water may be contaminated with multiple resistant bacteria, but animal models on gene transfer were mainly based on single-strain infections. In this study, we investigated the mobility of {$\beta$}-lactam resistance following infection with singleversus multi-strain of resistant bacteria under ampicillin treatment. We characterized three bacterial strains isolated from food-animal production systems, Escherichia coli O80:H26 and Salmonella enterica serovars Bredeney and Heidelberg. Each strain carries at least one conjugative plasmid that encodes a {$\beta$}-lactamase. We orally infected mice with each or all three bacterial strain(s) in the presence or absence of ampicillin treatment. We assessed plasmid transfer from the three donor bacteria to an introduced E. coli CV601gfp recipient in the mouse gut, and evaluated the impacts of the bacterial infection on gut microbiota and gut health. In the absence of ampicillin treatment, none of the donor or recipient bacteria established in the normal gut microbiota and plasmid transfer was not detected. In contrast, the ampicillin treatment disrupted the gut microbiota and enabled S. Bredeney and Heidelberg to colonize and transfer their plasmids to the E. coli CV601gfp recipient. E. coli O80:H26 on its own failed to colonize the mouse gut. However, during co-infection with the two Salmonella strains, E. coli O80:H26 colonized and transferred its plasmid to the E. coli CV601gfp recipient and a residential E. coli O2:H6 strain. The co-infection significantly increased plasmid transfer frequency, enhanced Proteobacteria expansion and resulted in inflammation in the mouse gut. Our findings suggest that single-strain infection models for evaluating in vivo gene transfer may underrepresent the consequences of multi-strain infections following the consumption of heavily contaminated food or water.},

The gut microbiota often suffers from various disturbances. It is not clear whether and how disturbed microbiota may affect ARG mobility under antibiotic treatments. For proof of concept, in the presence or absence of streptomycin pre-t\-reatment, mice were inoculated orally with a {$\beta$}-\-lactam-\-susceptible Salmonella enterica serovar Heidelberg clinical isolate (recipient) and a {$\beta$}-\-lactam resistant Escherichia coli O80:H26 isolate (donor) carrying a bla gene on an IncI2 plasmid. Immediately following inoculation, mice were CMY-\-2 treated with or without ampicillin in drinking water for 7\,days. Faeces were sampled, donor, recipient and transconjugant were enumerated, blaCMY-\-2 abundance was determined by quantitative PCR, faecal microbial community composition was determined by 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and cecal samples were observed histologically for evidence of inflammation. In faeces of mice that received streptomycin pre-\-treatment, the donor abundance remained high, and the abundance of S. Heidelberg transconjugant and the relative abundance of Enterobacteriaceae increased significantly during the ampicillin treatment. Co-\-blooming of the donor, transconjugant and commensal Enterobacteriaceae in the inflamed intestine promoted significantly (P{$<$}0.05) higher and possibly wider dissemination of the bla gene in the gut microbiota of mice that received the combination of streptomycin pre-t\-reatment and ampicillin treatment CMY-\-2 (Str--Amp) compared to the other mice. Following cessation of the ampicillin treatment, faecal shedding of S. Heidelberg transconjugant persisted much longer from mice in the Str--Amp group compared to the other mice. In addition, only mice in the Str--Amp group shed a commensal E. coli O2:H6 transconjugant, which carries three copies of the blaCMY-\-2 gene, one on the IncI2 plasmid and two on the chromosome. The findings highlight the significance of pre-\-existing gut microbiota for ARG dissemination and persistence during and following antibiotic treatments of infectious diseases.},

Herein, using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, we investigated the effects of replacing SBM with increasing inclusion levels (0-100\%) of BSFLM in broiler diets on the cecal bacterial community composition at each growth phase compared to broilers fed a basal corn-SBM diet with or without the in-feed antibiotic, bacitracin methylene disalicylate (BMD). We also evaluated the impact of low (12.5\% and 25\%) inclusion levels of BSFLM (LIL-BSFLM) on the prevalence of selected antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) in litter and cecal samples from 35-day-old birds. Results{\enspace} Compared to a conventional SBM-based broiler chicken diet, high (50 to100\%) inclusion levels of BSFLM (HIL-BSFLM) significantly altered the cecal bacterial composition and structure, whereas LIL-BSFLM had a minimal effect. Differential abundance analysis further revealed that the ceca of birds fed 100\% BSFLM consistently harbored a\,{\textasciitilde}\,3 log-fold higher abundance of Romboutsia and a\,{\textasciitilde}\,2 log-fold lower abundance of Shuttleworthia relative to those fed a BMD-supplemented control diet at all growth phases. Transient changes in the abundance of several potentially significant bacterial genera, primarily belonging to the class Clostridia, were also observed for birds fed HIL-BSFLM. At the finisher phase, Enterococci bacteria were enriched in the ceca of chickens raised without antibiotic, regardless of the level of dietary BSFLM. Additionally, bacitracin (bcrR) and macrolide (ermB) resistance genes were found to be less abundant in the ceca of chickens fed antibiotic-free diets, including either a corn-SBM or LIL-BSFLM diet. Conclusions{\enspace} Chickens fed a HIL-BSFLM presented with an imbalanced gut bacterial microbiota profile, which may be linked to the previously reported growth-depressing effects of a BSFLM diet. In contrast, LIL-BSFLM had a minimal effect on the composition of the cecal bacterial microbiota and did not enrich for selected ARGs. Thus, substitution of},

Antibiotic residues are entrained into agricultural soil through the application of animal and human wastes, and irrigation with reclaimed water. The impact of a mixture of three macrolide antibiotics on the abundance of selected genes associated with antibiotic resistance and genetic mobility were determined in a long-term field experiment undertaken in London, Canada. Replicated plots received annual applications of a mixture of erythromycin, clarithromycin and azithromycin every spring since 2010. Each antibiotic was added directly to the soil at a concentration of either 0.1 or 10 mg kg soil-1 and all plots were cropped to soybeans. By means of qPCR, no gene targets were enriched in soil exposed to the 0.1 mg kg soil-1 dose compared to untreated control. In contrast, the relative abundance of several gene targets including int1, sul2 and mphE increased significantly with the annual exposure to the 10 mg kg soil-1 dose. By means of high-throughput qPCR, numerous gene targets associated with resistance to aminoglycosides, sulfonamides, trimethoprim, streptomycin, quaternary ammonium chemicals as well as mobile genetic elements (tnpA, IS26 and IS6100) were detected in soil exposed to 10 mg kg soil-1, but not the lower dose. Overall, exposure of soil to macrolide antibiotics increased the relative abundance of numerous gene targets associated with resistance to macrolides and other antibiotics, and mobile genetic elements. This occurred at an exposure dose that is unrealistically high, but did not occur at the lower more realistic exposure dose.},

Recently, there has been an increase in the number of ``natural'' feedlots in the beef cattle sector that raise cattle without antibiotics. Shotgun metagenomics was employed to characterize the impact of AMU in feedlot cattle on the microbiome, resistome, and mobilome. Sequenced fecal samples identified a decline (q {$<$} 0.01) in the genera Methanobrevibacter and Treponema in the microbiome of naturally vs. conventionally raised feedlot cattle, but this difference was not (q {$>$} 0.05) observed in catch basin samples. No differences (q {$>$} 0.05) were found in the classlevel resistome between feedlot practices. In fecal samples, decreases from conventional to natural (q {$<$} 0.05) were noted in reads for the antimicrobial-resistant genes (ARGs) mef A, tet40, tetO, tetQ, and tetW. Plasmid-associated ARGs were more common in feces from conventional than natural feedlot cattle. Interestingly, more chromosomal- than plasmid-associated macrolide resistance genes were observed in both natural and conventional feedlots, suggesting that they were more stably conserved than the predominately plasmid-associated tetracycline resistance genes. This study suggests that generationally selected resistomes through decades of AMU persist even after AMU ceases in natural production systems.},

  abstract = {Background. The molecular profiling of complex microbial communities has become the basis for examining the relationship between the microbiome composition, structure and metabolic functions of those communities. Microbial community structure can be partially assessed with ``universal'' PCR targeting taxonomic or functional gene markers. Increasingly, shotgun metagenomic DNA sequencing is providing more quantitative insight into microbiomes. However, both amplicon-based and shotgun sequencing approaches have shortcomings that limit the ability to study microbiome dynamics. Methods. We present a novel, amplicon-free, hybridization-based method (CaptureSeq) for profiling complex microbial communities using probes based on the chaperonin60 gene. Molecular profiles of a commercially available synthetic microbial community standard were compared using CaptureSeq, whole metagenome sequencing, and 16S universal target amplification. Profiles were also generated for natural ecosystems including antibiotic-amended soils, manure storage tanks, and an agricultural reservoir. Results. The CaptureSeq method generated a microbial profile that encompassed all of the bacteria and eukaryotes in the panel with greater reproducibility and more accurate representation of high G/C content microorganisms compared to 16S amplification. In the natural ecosystems, CaptureSeq provided a much greater depth of coverage and sensitivity of detection compared to shotgun sequencing without prior selection. The resulting community profiles provided quantitatively reliable information about all three domains of life (Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya) in the different ecosystems. The applications of CaptureSeq will facilitate accurate studies of host-microbiome interactions for environmental, crop, animal and human health. Conclusions: cpn60-based hybridization enriched for taxonomically informative DNA sequences from complex mixtures. In synthetic and natural microbial ecosystems, CaptureSeq provided sequences from prokaryotes and eukaryotes simultaneously, with quantitatively reliable read abundances. CaptureSeq provides an alternative to PCR amplification of taxonomic markers with deep community coverage while minimizing amplification biases.},

  abstract = {Geographic food fraud -- misrepresenting the geographic origin of a food item, is very difficult to detect, and therefore this type of fraud tends to go undetected. This potentially negatively impacts the health of Canadians and economic success of our seafood industry. Surveillance studies have shown that up to a significant portion of commercially sold seafood items in Canada are mislabeled or otherwise misrepresented in some way. The current study aimed to determine if the microbiome of fresh shellfish could be used as an accurate marker of harvest location. Total DNA was extracted from the homogenate of 25 batches of fresh soft-shell clams (Mya arenaria) harvested in 2015 and 2018 from two locations on the East Coast of Canada and the microbiome of each homogenate was characterized using 16S rRNA targeted amplicon sequencing. Clams harvested from Nova Scotia in both years had a higher abundance of Proteobacteria and Acidobacteria (p {$<$} 0.05), but a lower abundance of Actinobacteria (p {$<$} 0.05) than those from Quebec. Alpha-diversity also differed significantly between sites. Samples harvested from Nova Scotia had greater diversity (p {$<$} 0.0001) than those from Quebec. Beta-diversity analysis showed that the microbial community composition was significantly different between the samples from Nova Scotia and Quebec and indicated that 16S rRNA targeted amplicon sequencing might be an effective tool for elucidating the geographic origin of unprocessed shellfish. To evaluate if the microbiome of shellfish experiences a loss of microbial diversity during processing and storage --which would limit the ability of this technique to link retail samples to geographic origin, 10 batches of retail clams purchased from grocery stores were also examined. Microbial diversity and species richness was significantly lower in retail clams, and heavily dominated by Proteobacteria, a typical spoilage organism for fresh seafood, this may make determining the geographic origin of seafood items more difficult in retail clams than in freshly harvested clams.},

  abstract = {Agroecosystems are comprised of environmental compartments where associated microbial communities interact with one another. These microbial communities, called microbiomes, inhabit livestock, insects, and plants. Microbiomes are also present in the soil and watersheds. Clarifying the nature and extent of microbial interactions between compartments both at intra-farm and global scales can promote sustainable production systems, healthier animals, increased crop yields, and safer meat products. Early research on microbiomes was hindered by a lack of expertise and the high cost of molecular sequencing. However, these limitations have been largely resolved with advances in and reduced costs of sequencing technologies. In this paper, we summarize sequencing and bioinformatics approaches, and review the crucial roles of diverse microbiomes in livestock, plants and soil, as well as pollinators and pest insects. These crucial roles include nutrient cycling, nutrient acquisition, metabolism of toxins and enhanced host immune function. Additionally, we examine potentially undesirable effects of microbiomes associated with climate change and agri-food production such as their role in the release of greenhouse gases from cattle and their impact on meat safety and spoilage. By increasing the awareness of microbiomes and the growing ease with which they can be studied, we hope to foster a greater adoption of microbiome research. Further understanding of the diverse effects and interactions of microbiomes will advance our efforts to increase agricultural production while reducing its negative environmental footprint, thus making the agroecosystems more sustainable.},

The carbapenems are in an antimicrobial class considered last-resort, they are used to treat human infections caused by multidrug-resistant Enterobacterales, and they are classified by the World Health Organization as `High Priority Critically Important Antimicrobials'. The presence of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CREs) of animal-origin is of concern because targeted studies of Canadian retail seafood revealed the presence of carbapenem resistance in a small number of Enterobacterales isolates. To further investigate this issue, a risk profile was developed examining shrimp and salmon, the two most important seafood commodities consumed by Canadians and Escherichia coli, a member of the Enterobacterales order. Carbapenem-resistant E. coli (CREc) isolates have been identified in shrimp and other seafood products. Although carbapenem use in aquaculture has not been reported, several classes of antimicrobials are utilised globally and co-selection of antimicrobial-resistant microorganisms in an aquaculture setting is also of concern. CREs have been identified in retail seafood purchased in Canada and are currently thought to be uncommon. However, data concerning CRE or CREc occurrence and distribution in seafood are limited, and argue for implementation of ongoing or periodic surveillance.},

The isolates displayed decreased susceptibility to florfenicol (65.5\%), chloramphenicol (7.3\%), tetracycline (52.7\%), ampicillin (49.1\%), streptomycin (34.5\%), kanamycin (20.0\%), gentamycin (10.9\%), amikacin (1.8\%), amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (21.8\%), ceftiofur (18.2\%), ceftriaxone (3.6\%), trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole (12.7\%), and cefoxitin (3.6\%). All surface water and sediment isolates were susceptible to ciprofloxacin, nalidixic acid, ertapenem, imipenem and meropenem. Eight isolates (14.6\%) were multidrug resistant. ARDs conferring resistance to phenicols (floR), trimethoprim (dfrA), sulfonamides (sul1/2), tetracyclines (tetA/B), and aminoglycosides (aadA and aph) were detected. Additionally, narrow-spectrum {$\beta$}-lactamase blaTEM-1b and extended-spectrum AmpC {$\beta$}-lactamase (cephalosporinase) blaCMY-2 were detected in the genomes, as were replicons from plasmid incompatibility groups IncFII, IncB/O/K/Z, IncQ1, IncX1, IncY and Col156. A comparison with surveillance data revealed that AR phenotypes and ARDs were comparable to those reported in generic E. coli from food animals. Aquatic environments in the region are potential reservoirs for the maintenance and transmission of antibiotic resistant STEC, associated ARDs and their plasmids.},

  abstract = {Background:{\enspace} Assessment of the burden of disease due to antimicrobial-resistant Escherichia coli infections facilitates understanding the scale of the problem and potential impacts, and comparison to other diseases, which allows prior-itization of research, surveillance, and funding. Using systematic review and meta-analysis methodology, the objec-tives were to evaluate whether humans with antimicrobial-resistant E. coli infections experience increases in measures of health or healthcare system burden when compared to susceptible E. coli infections. Methods:{\enspace} Comprehensive literature searches were performed in four primary and seven grey literature databases. Analytic observational studies of human E. coli infections that assessed the impact of resistance to third/fourth/fifthgeneration cephalosporins, resistance to quinolones, and/or multidrug resistance on mortality, treatment failure, length of hospital stay and/or healthcare costs were included. Two researchers independently performed screening, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment. When possible, random effect meta-analyses followed by assessment of the confidence in the cumulative evidence were performed for mortality and length of hospital stay outcomes, and narrative syntheses were performed for treatment failure and healthcare costs. Results:{\enspace} Literature searches identified 14,759 de-duplicated records and 76 articles were included. Based on 30-day and all-cause mortality meta-analyses, regardless of the type of resistance, there was a significant increase in the odds of dying with resistant E. coli infections compared to susceptible infections. A summary mean difference was not presented for total length of hospital stay meta-analyses due to substantial to considerable heterogeneity. Since small numbers of studies contributed to meta-analyses for bacterium-attributable mortality and post-infection length of hospital stay, the summary results should be considered with caution. Studies contributing results for treatment failure and healthcare costs had considerable variability in definitions and reporting. Conclusions:{\enspace} Overall, resistant E. coli infections were associated with significant 30-day and all-cause mortality burden. More research and/or improved reporting are necessary to facilitate quantitative syntheses of bacteriumattributable mortality, length of hospital stay, and hospital costs.

  abstract = {Nontyphoidal Salmonella (NTS) is a leading global cause of bacterial foodborne morbidity and mortality. Our ability to treat severe NTS infections has been impaired by increasing antimicrobial resistance (AMR). To understand and mitigate the global health crisis AMR represents, we need to link the observed resistance phenotypes with their underlying genomic mechanisms. Broiler chickens represent a key reservoir and vector for NTS infections, but isolates from this setting have been characterized in only very low numbers relative to clinical isolates. In this study, we sequenced and assembled 97 genomes encompassing 7 serotypes isolated from broiler chicken in farms in British Columbia between 2005 and 2008. Through application of machine learning (ML) models to predict the observed AMR phenotype from this genomic data, we were able to generate highly (0.92 to 0.99) precise logistic regression models using known AMR gene annotations as features for 7 antibiotics (amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, ampicillin, cefoxitin, ceftiofur, ceftriaxone, streptomycin, and tetracycline). Similarly, we also trained ``reference-free'' k-merbased set-covering machine phenotypic prediction models (0.91 to 1.0 precision) for these antibiotics. By combining the inferred k-mers and logistic regression weights, we identified the primary drivers of AMR for the 7 studied antibiotics in these isolates. With our research representing one of the largest studies of a diverse set of NTS isolates from broiler chicken, we can thus confirm that the AmpC-like CMY-2 ␤-lactamase is a primary driver of ␤-lactam resistance and that the phosphotransferases APH(6)-Id and APH(3{\cyrchar\CYRLJE}-Ib) are the principal drivers of streptomycin resistance in this important ecosystem.},

Antibiotics have been used not only for the treatment and prevention of such diseases, but also for growth promotion. Consequently, these practices have been linked to the selection and spread of antimicrobial resistant bacteria which constitute a significant global threat to humans, animals, and the environment. To break down the antimicrobial resistance (AMR), poultry producers are restricting the antimicrobial use (AMU) while adopting the antibiotic-free (ABF) and organic production practices to satisfy consumers' demands. However, it is not well understood how ABF and organic poultry production practices influence AMR profiles in the poultry gut microbiome. Various Gram-negative (Salmonella enterica serovars, Campylobacter jejuni/ coli, E. coli) and Gram-positive (Enterococcus spp., Staphylococcus spp. and C. perfringens) bacteria harboring multiple AMR determinants have been reported in poultry including organically- and ABF-raised chickens. In this review, we discussed major poultry production systems (conventional, ABF and organic) and their impacts on AMR in some potential pathogenic Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria which could allow identifying issues and opportunities to develop efficient and safe production practices in controlling pathogens.},

Described here are the results of Canadian national surveillance of S. Dublin from 2003 to 2015 in humans and bovines, principally collected through the Canadian Integrated Program for Antibiotic Resistance Surveillance (CIPARS). An increase in human infections due to multidrug-resistant (MDR) S. Dublin was observed in 2010, many of which were bloodstream infections. Phylogenomic analysis of human and bovine isolates revealed a closely related network that differed by only 0 to 17 single nucleotide variants (SNVs), suggesting some potential transmission between humans and bovines. Phylogenomic comparison of global publicly available sequences of S. Dublin showed that Canadian isolates clustered closely with those from the United States. A high correlation between phenotypic and genotypic antimicrobial susceptibility was observed in Canadian isolates. IS26 replication was widespread among U.S. and Canadian isolates and caused the truncation and inactivation of the resistance genes strA and blaTEM-1B. A hybrid virulence and MDR plasmid (pN13-01125) isolated from a Canadian S. Dublin isolate was searched against NCBI SRA data of bacteria. The pN13-01125 coding sequences were found in 13 Salmonella serovars, but S. Dublin appears to be a specific reservoir. In summary, we have observed the rise of invasive MDR S. Dublin in humans in Canada and found that they are closely related to bovine isolates and to American isolates in their mobile and chromosomal contents.},

Although several national surveillance programs are in place for clinical and veterinary settings, no such schemes exist for monitoring antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the en\- vironment. In this transnational study, we developed, validated, and tested a low-cost surveillance and easy to implement approach to evaluate antibiotic resistance in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) by targeting cefotaxime-resistant (CTX-R) coliforms as indicators. The rationale for this approach was: i) coliform quantifi\- cation methods are internationally accepted as indicators of fecal contamination in recreational waters and are therefore routinely applied in analytical labs; ii) CTX-R coliforms are clinically relevant, associated with ex\- tended-spectrum {$\beta$}-lactamases (ESBLs), and are rare in pristine environments. We analyzed 57 WWTPs in 22 countries across Europe, Asia, Africa, Australia, and North America. CTX-R coliforms were ubiquitous in raw sewage and their relative abundance varied significantly ({$<$} 0.1\% to 38.3\%), being positively correlated (p {$<$} 0.001) with regional atmospheric temperatures. Although most WWTPs removed large proportions of CTX-R coliforms, loads over 103 colony-forming units per mL were occasionally observed in final effluents. We demonstrate that CTX-R coliform monitoring is a feasible and affordable approach to assess wastewater anti\- biotic resistance status.},

Being designed for pharmacological stability, most antibiotics are recalcitrant to biodegradation after ingestion and can be persistent in the environment. Antibiotic residues have been detected as contaminants in various environmental compartments where they cause human and environmental threats, notably with respect to the potential emergence and proliferation of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. An important component of managing environmental risk caused by antibiotics is to understand exposure of soil and water resources to their residues. One challenge is to gain knowledge on the fate of antibiotics in the ecosystem along the soil-water continuum, and on the collateral impact of antibiotics on environmental microorganisms responsible for crucially important ecosystem functions. In this context, the ANTIBIOTOX project aims at studying the environmental fate and impact of two antibiotics of the sulfonamide class of antibiotics, sulfamethazine (SMZ), and sulfamethoxazole (SMX).},

  abstract = {Background: ESBL-producing bacteria pose a serious challenge to both clinical care and public health. There is no standard measure of the burden of illness (BOI) of ESBL-producing Escherichia coli (ESBL-EC) in the published literature, indicating a need to synthesize available BOI data to provide an overall understanding of the impact of ESBL-EC infections on human health. Objectives: To summarize the characteristics of BOI reporting in the ESBL-EC literature to (i) describe how BOI associated with antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is measured and reported; (ii) summarize differences in other aspects of reporting between studies; and (iii) highlight the common themes in research objectives and their relation to ESBL-EC BOI. Methods and results: Two literature searches, run in 2013 and 2018, were conducted to capture published studies evaluating the BOI associated with ESBL-EC infections in humans. These searches identified 1723 potentially relevant titles and abstracts. After relevance screening of titles and abstracts and review of full texts, 27 studies were included for qualitative data synthesis. This review identified variability in the reporting and use of BOI measures, study characteristics, definitions and laboratory methods for identifying ESBL-EC infections. Conclusions: Decision makers often require BOI data to make science-based decisions for the implementation of surveillance activities or risk reduction policies. Similarly, AMR BOI measures are important components of risk analyses and economic evaluations of AMR. This review highlights many limitations to current ESBL-EC BOI reporting, which, if improved upon, will ensure data accessibility and usefulness for ESBL-EC BOI researchers, decision makers and clinicians.},

  abstract = {Bacterial pathogens, such as Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) and Shigella spp., are important causes of foodborne illness internationally. Recovery of these organisms from foods is critical for food safety investigations to support attribution of illnesses to specific food commodities; however, isolation of bacterial cultures can be challenging. Methods for the isolation of STEC and Shigella spp. from foods typically require enrichment to amplify target organisms to detectable levels. Yet, during enrichment, target organisms can be outcompeted by other bacteria in food matrices due to faster growth rates, or through production of antimicrobial agents such as bacteriocins or bacteriophages. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the occurrence of Shigella and STEC inhibitors produced by food microbiota. The production of antimicrobial compounds in cell-free extracts from 200 bacterial strains and 332 food-enrichment broths was assessed. Cellfree extracts produced by 23 (11.5\%) of the strains tested inhibited growth of at least one of the five Shigella and seven STEC indicator strains used in this study. Of the 332 enrichment broths tested, cell-free extracts from 25 (7.5\%) samples inhibited growth of at least one of the indicator strains tested. Inhibition was most commonly associated with E. coli recovered from meat products. Most of the inhibiting compounds were determined to be proteinaceous (34 of the 48 positive samples, 71\%; including 17 strains, 17 foods) based on inactivation by proteolytic enzymes, indicating presence of bacteriocins. The cell-free extracts from 13 samples (27\%, eight strains, five foods) were determined to contain bacteriophages based on the observation of plaques in diluted extracts and/or resistance to proteolytic enzymes. These results indicate that the production of inhibitors by food microbiota may be an important challenge for the recovery of foodborne pathogens, particularly for Shigella sonnei. The performance of enrichment media for recovery of Shigella and STEC could be improved by mitigating the impact of inhibitors produced by food microbiota during the enrichment process.},

Litter (27.5 T/ha) was applied to 24 agricultural plots in the Fraser Valley of British Columbia. Nonfertilized plots were used as a negative control. Soil samples collected from the studied plots were used to quantify Escherichia coli by plate counts, and Clostridium perfringens by qPCR. The 16S rRNA gene sequencing was performed for microbiota analysis. Following litter application in December, the population size of E. coli was 5.4 log CFU/g; however, regardless of treatments, the results revealed 5.2 and 1.4 log CFU/g of E. coli in soil sampled in January and March, respectively. Fertilization with litter from antibiotic-treated birds increased (P {$<$} 0.05) the relative abundance of Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Firmicutes in soil, but decreased Acidobacteria and Verrucomicrobia groups. The alpha diversity parameters were higher (P {$<$} 0.05) in nonfertilized soil compared to the fertilized ones, suggesting that litter application was a major factor in shaping the soil bacterial communities. These results may help develop efficient litter management strategies like composting, autoclaving, or anaerobic digestion of poultry litter before application to land for preservation of soil health and crop productivity.},

  abstract = {Next Generation Sequencing technologies significantly impact the field of Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) detection and monitoring, with immediate uses in diagnosis and risk assessment. For this application and in general, considerable challenges remain in demonstrating sufficient trust to act upon the meaningful information produced from raw data, partly because of the reliance on bioinformatics pipelines, which can produce different results and therefore lead to different interpretations. With the constant evolution of the field, it is difficult to identify, harmonise and recommend specific methods for large-scale implementations over time. In this article, we propose to address this challenge through establishing a transparent, performance-based, evaluation approach to provide flexibility in the bioinformatics tools of choice, while demonstrating proficiency in meeting common performance standards. The approach is two-fold: first, a community-driven effort to establish and maintain ``live'' (dynamic) benchmarking platforms to provide relevant performance metrics, based on different use-cases, that would evolve together with the AMR field; second, agreed and defined datasets to allow the pipelines' implementation, validation, and quality-control over time. Following previous discussions on the main challenges linked to this approach, we provide concrete recommendations and future steps, related to different aspects of the design of benchmarks, such as the selection and the characteristics of the datasets (quality, choice of pathogens and resistances, etc.), the evaluation criteria of the pipelines, and the way these resources should be deployed in the community.},

Pure cultures of Shigatoxin-producing Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, Listeria monocytogenes, and Vibrio parahaemolyticus were subcultured daily for 100 successive days. The 1st and 100th subcultures were whole-genome sequenced using short-read sequencing. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified between the 1st and final culture using 2 different approaches, and multilocus sequence typing of the whole genome was also performed to detect any changes at the allelic level. The number of observed genomic changes varied by strain, species, and the SNP caller used. This study provides insight into the genomic variation that can be detected using next-generation sequencing and analysis methods after repeated subculturing of 4 important bacterial pathogens.},

Consumption of turkey meat may be an important source of foodborne exposure to resistant bacteria; recent outbreaks of multi-drug-resistant Salmonella Reading in Canada and the USA have implicated raw turkey products. To better understand the epidemiology of AMR in farmed turkey production, a scoping review was conducted. The objectives were to identify (1) modifiable factors potentially associated with antimicrobial-resistant Campylobacter, Enterococcus, Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica along the farm-to-fork pathway in turkeys, and (2) data gaps with respect to factors potentially associated with AMR and Canadian commercial turkey production. A comprehensive search of the peer-reviewed literature was conducted in 2019 and updated in 2021. Thirteen references were included, reporting 36 factors. Antimicrobial use factors and their potential associations with AMR were most frequently reported (n = 15 factors; 42\%), followed by biosecurity (n = 11; 31\%) and management practices (n = 10; 28\%). This review revealed important data gaps; no factors pertaining to S. enterica or to stages other than the farm (e.g. abattoir, retail) were identified, and only one Canadian reference was identified. These findings will inform priorities for future research and surveillance regarding turkeys and AMR.},

  abstract = {Pigs are major reservoirs of resistant Enterobacteriaceae that can reach humans through consumption of contaminated meat or vegetables grown in manure-fertilized soil. Samples were collected from sows during lactation and from their piglets at five time points spanning the production cycle. Cefotaxime-resistant bacteria were quantified and isolated from feed, feces, manures, and carcasses of pigs reared with penicillin-using or antibiotic-free husbandries. The isolates were characterized by antibiotic susceptibility testing, whole-genome sequencing, and conjugation assays. The extended-spectrum b-lactamase (ESBL) phenotype was more frequent in isolates originating from antibiotic-free animals, while the bacteria isolated from penicillin-using animals were on average resistant to a greater number of antibiotics. The ESBL-encoding genes identified were blaCTX-M-1, blaCTX-M-15, and blaCMY-2, and they colocalized on plasmids with various genes encoding resistance to b-lactams, co-trimoxazole, phenicols, and tetracycline, all antibiotics used in pig production. Groups of genes conferring the observed resistance and the mobile elements disseminating multidrug resistance were determined. The observed resistance to b-lactams was mainly due to the complementary actions of penicillin-binding proteins, an efflux pump, and b-lactamases. Most resistance determinants were shared by animals raised with or without antimicrobials. This suggests a key contribution of indigenous enterobacteria maternally transmitted along the sow lineage regardless of antimicrobial use. It is unclear whether the antimicrobial resistance observed in the enterobacterial populations of the commercial pig herds studied was present before the use of antibiotics or the extent to which historical antimicrobial use exerted a selective pressure defining the resistant bacterial populations in farms using penicillin prophylaxis.},

The prevalence of PCR-confirmed ESBL-EC in agrifood samples ranged from 0.5\% to 3\% across the surveillance years, and was detected most frequently in samples from broiler chicken farms. The overall prevalence of PCR-confirmed ESBL-SA varied between 1\% and 4\% between 2012 and 2017, and was most frequently detected in clinical isolates from domestic cattle.

  abstract = {Heidelberg is among the top three Salmonella enterica serovars associated with human foodborne illness in Canada. Traditional culture and antimicrobial susceptibility testing techniques can be time-consuming to identify Salmonella Heidelberg resistant to cephalosporins and fosfomycin. Rapid and accurate detection of such antibiotic-resistant Salmonella Heidelberg isolates is essential to adopt appropriate control measures. In this study, 15 Salmonella Heidelberg strains isolated from feces of Canadian broiler chickens were characterized by whole genome sequencing. Salmonella Heidelberg genomes had an average coverage of greater than 80-fold, an average of 4,761 protein-coding genes, and all belonged to multilocus sequence type ST15. Genome sequences were compared with genomes in the National Center for Biotechnology Information Pathogen Detection database (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/), including human outbreak isolates. The Canadian broiler isolates clustered with chicken isolates from the United States and an equine clinical isolate from Ontario, Canada. In agreement with their antimicrobial resistance phenotypes, several chromosomally encoded specific antimicrobial resistance genes including fosA7 and multidrug resistance efflux pump determinants were detected. An AmpC-like b-lactamase gene, blaCMY-2, linked with a quaternary ammonium compound resistance gene, sugE, on a replicon type IncI1 plasmid was detected in all 15 broiler Salmonella Heidelberg isolates. Of the 205,031 published Salmonella genomes screened in silico, 4,954 (2.4\%) contained blaCMY-2, 8,143 (4.0\%) contained fosA7, and 919 (0.4\%) contained both resistance genes. The combination of both resistance genes (fosA7 and blaCMY-2) was detected in 64\% of the Heidelberg genomes and in a small proportion of various other serovars. A PCR method was developed to detect Salmonella Heidelberg in pure culture and chicken feces based on specific primers targeting genes conferring fosfomycin (fosA7) and third-generation cephalosporin (blaCMY-2) resistance as well as the Salmonella-specific invA gene and the universal 16S rRNA genes. The PCR assay was specific and sensitive for blaCMY-2 and fosA7 harboring Salmonella Heidelberg. However, some other Salmonella serovars containing these two resistance genes could also be detected by the developed PCR method.},

In this study, 57 antimicrobial-resistant E. coli from apparently healthy broiler chickens were characterized for their health and safety risks. These isolates belonged to 12 serotypes, and isolates of the same serotype were clonal based on single nucleotide variant analysis. Most of the isolates harbored plasmids; IncC and IncFIA were frequently detected. The majority of the resistant isolates harbored plasmid-mediated resistance genes, including aph(300)-Ib, aph(6)-Id, blaCMY-2, floR, sul1, sul2, tet(A), and tet(B), in agreement with their resistant phenotypes. The class 1 integron was detected in all E. coli serotypes except O124:H25 and O7:H6. Of the 57 broiler E. coli isolates, 27 were avian pathogenic, among which 18 were also uropathogenic E. coli and the remainder were other ExPEC. The two isolates of serotype O161:H4 (ST117) were genetically related to the control avian pathogenic strains and a clinical isolate associated with UTIs. A strain of serotype O159:H45 (ST101) also was closely related to a UTI isolate. The detected virulence factors included adhesins, invasins, siderophores, type III secretion systems, and toxins in combination with other virulence determinants. A broiler isolate of serotype O7:H18 (ST38) carried the ibeA gene encoding a protein involved in invasion of brain endothelium on a 102-kbp genetic island. This isolate moderately adhered and invaded Caco-2 cells and induced mortality (42.5\%) in a day-old-chick infection model. The results of this study suggest that multiple antimicrobial-resistant E. coli isolates recovered from apparent healthy broilers can be pathogenic and act as reservoirs for antimicrobial resistance genes, highlighting the necessity of their assessment in a ``One-Heath'' context.},

  abstract = {Plasmids are the primary vector for horizontal transfer of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) within bacterial populations. We applied the MOB-\-suite, a toolset for reconstructing and typing plasmids, to 150{$\mkern1mu$}767 publicly available Salmonella whole-\-genome sequencing samples covering 1204 distinct serovars to produce a large-s\- cale population survey of plasmids based on the MOB-\-suite plasmid nomenclature. Reconstruction yielded 183{$\mkern1mu$}017 plasmids representing 1044 primary MOB-\-clusters and 830 potentially novel MOB-c\- lusters. Replicon and relaxase typing were able to type 83.4 and 58{$\mkern1mu\%$} of plasmids, respectively, compared to 99.9{$\mkern1mu\%$} for MOB-\-clusters. Within this work, we developed an approach to characterize the horizonal transfer of MOB-\-clusters and AMR genes across different serotypes, as well as the diversity of MOB-c\- luster associations with AMR genes. Aggregating conjugative mobility predictions provided by the MOB-\-suite and their corresponding serovar entropy demonstrated that non-m\- obilizable plasmids were associated with fewer serotypes compared to mobilizable or conjugative MOB-\-clusters. The host-r\-ange predictions for MOB-\-clusters also showed differences between the mobility classes, with mobilizable MOB-\- clusters accounting for 88.3{$\mkern1mu\%$} of the multi-p\- hyla (broad-\-host-\-range) predictions compared to 3 and 8.6{$\mkern1mu\%$} for conjugative and non-\-mobilizable, respectively. A total of 296 (22{$\mkern1mu\%$}) of identified MOB-\-clusters were associated with at least one resistance gene, indicating that the majority of Salmonella plasmids are not involved in AMR dissemination. Shannon entropy analysis of horizontal transfer of AMR genes across serovars and MOB-c\- lusters demonstrated that horizonal transfer of genes is higher between serovars compared to transfer between different MOB-c\- lusters. In addition to the population structure characterization based on primary MOB-c\- lusters, we characterized a multi-p\- lasmid outbreak responsible for the global dissemination of blaCMY-\-2 across different serotypes using higher resolution MOB-s\- uite secondary cluster codes. The plasmid characterization approach developed here can be applied to different organisms to identify plasmids and genes which pose high risks for horizontal transfer.},

  abstract = {Large-scale bacterial population genetics studies are now routine due to cost-effective Illumina short-read sequencing. However, analysing plasmid content remains difficult due to incomplete assembly of plasmids. Bacterial isolates can contain any number of plasmids and assembly remains complicated due to the presence of repetitive elements. Numerous tools have been developed to analyse plasmids but the performance and functionality of the tools are variable. The MOB-suite was developed as a set of modular tools for reconstruction and typing of plasmids from draft assembly data to facilitate characterization of plasmids. Using a set of closed genomes with publicly available Illumina data, the MOB-suite identified contigs of plasmid origin with both high sensitivity and specificity (95 and 88 \%, respectively). In comparison, plasmidfinder demonstrated high specificity (99 \%) but limited sensitivity (50 \%). Using the same dataset of 377 known plasmids, MOB-recon accurately reconstructed 207 plasmids so that they were assigned to a single grouping without other plasmid or chromosomal sequences, whereas plasmidSPAdes was only able to accurately reconstruct 102 plasmids. In general, plasmidSPAdes has a tendency to merge different plasmids together, with 208 plasmids undergoing merge events. The MOB-suite reduces the number of errors but produces more hybrid plasmids, with 84 plasmids undergoing both splits and merges. The MOB-suite also provides replicon typing similar to plasmidfinder but with the inclusion of relaxase typing and prediction of conjugation potential. The MOB-suite is written in Python 3 and is available from https://github.com/phac-nml/mob-suite.},

  abstract = {Bacterial plasmids play a large role in allowing bacteria to adapt to changing environments and can pose a significant risk to human health if they confer virulence and antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Plasmids differ significantly in the taxonomic breadth of host bacteria in which they can successfully replicate, this is commonly referred to as `host range' and is usually described in qualitative terms of `narrow' or `broad'. Understanding the host range potential of plasmids is of great interest due to their ability to disseminate traits such as AMR through bacterial populations and into human pathogens. We developed the MOB-s\- uite to facilitate characterization of plasmids and introduced a whole-\-sequence-\-based classification system based on clustering complete plasmid sequences using Mash distances (https://github.com/phac-nml/mob-suite). We updated the MOB-s\- uite database from 12{$\mkern1mu$}091 to 23{$\mkern1mu$}671 complete sequences, representing 17{$\mkern1mu$}779 unique plasmids. With advances in new algorithms for rapidly calculating average nucleotide identity (ANI), we compared clustering characteristics using two different distance measures --Mash and ANI -- and three clustering algorithms on the unique set of plasmids. The plasmid nomenclature is designed to group highly similar plasmids together that are unlikely to have multiple representatives within a single cell. Based on our results, we determined that clusters generated using Mash and complete-l\-inkage clustering at a Mash distance of 0.06 resulted in highly homogeneous clusters while maintaining cluster size. The taxonomic distribution of plasmid biomarker sequences for replication and relaxase typing, in combination with MOB-\-suite whole-\-sequence-\-based clusters have been examined in detail for all high-\-quality publicly available plasmid sequences. We have incorporated prediction of plasmid replication host range into the MOB-s\- uite based on observed distributions of these sequence features in combination with known plasmid hosts from the literature. Host range is reported as the highest taxonomic rank that covers all of the plasmids which share replicon or relaxase biomarkers or belong to the same MOB-\-suite cluster code. Reporting host range based on these criteria allows for comparisons of host range between studies and provides information for plasmid surveillance.},

Vancomycin-Resistant Enterococcus (VRE) are candidates for gauging the degree of AMR bacteria in wastewater. Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium are recognized indicators of fecal contamination in water. Comparative genomics of enterococci isolated from conventional activated sludge (CAS) and biological aerated filter (BAF) WWTPs was conducted. Results: VRE isolates, including E. faecalis (n = 24), E. faecium (n = 11), E. casseliflavus (n = 2) and E. gallinarum (n = 2) were selected for sequencing based on WWTP source, species and AMR phenotype. The pangenomes of E. faecium and E. faecalis were both open. The genomic fraction related to the mobilome was positively correlated with genome size in E. faecium (p {$<$} 0.001) and E. faecalis (p {$<$} 0.001) and with the number of AMR genes in E. faecium (p = 0.005). Genes conferring vancomycin resistance, including vanA and vanM (E. faecium), vanG (E. faecalis), and vanC (E. casseliflavus/E. gallinarum), were detected in 20 genomes. The most prominent functional AMR genes were efflux pumps and transporters. A minimum of 16, 6, 5 and 3 virulence genes were detected in E. faecium, E. faecalis, E. casseliflavus and E. gallinarum, respectively. Virulence genes were more common in E. faecalis and E. faecium, than E. casseliflavus and E. gallinarum. A number of mobile genetic elements were shared among species. Functional CRISPR/Cas arrays were detected in 13 E. faecalis genomes, with all but one also containing a prophage. The lack of a functional CRISPR/Cas arrays was associated with multi-drug resistance in E. faecium. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated differential clustering of isolates based on original source but not WWTP. Genes related to phage and CRISPR/Cas arrays could potentially serve as environmental biomarkers. Conclusions: There was no discernible difference between enterococcal genomes from the CAS and BAF WWTPs. E. faecalis and E. faecium have smaller genomes and harbor more virulence, AMR, and mobile genetic elements than other Enterococcus spp.},

  abstract = {Background{\enspace} With the escalating risk of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), there are limited analytical options avail-able that can comprehensively assess the burden of AMR carried by clinical/environmental samples. Food can be a potential source of AMR bacteria for humans, but its significance in driving the clinical spread of AMR remains unclear, largely due to the lack of holistic-yet-sensitive tools for surveillance and evaluation. Metagenomics is a culture-inde-pendent approach well suited for uncovering genetic determinants of defined microbial traits, such as AMR, present within unknown bacterial communities. Despite its popularity, the conventional approach of non-selectively sequenc-ing a sample's metagenome (namely, shotgun-metagenomics) has several technical drawbacks that lead to uncer-tainty about its effectiveness for AMR assessment; for instance, the low discovery rate of resistance-associated genes due to their naturally small genomic footprint within the vast metagenome. Here, we describe the development of a targeted resistome sequencing method and demonstrate its application in the characterization of the AMR gene profile of bacteria associated with several retail foods. Result{\enspace} A targeted-metagenomic sequencing workflow using a customized bait-capture system targeting over 4,000 referenced AMR genes and 263 plasmid replicon sequences was validated against both mock and sample-derived bacterial community preparations. Compared to shotgun-metagenomics, the targeted method consistently provided for improved recovery of resistance gene targets with a much-improved target detection efficiency ({$>$}\,300-fold). Tar-geted resistome analyses conducted on 36 retail-acquired food samples (fresh sprouts, n\,=\,10; ground meat, n\,=\,26) and their corresponding bacterial enrichment cultures (n\,=\,36) reveals in-depth features regarding the identity and diversity of AMR genes, most of which were otherwise undetected by the whole-metagenome shotgun sequencing method. Furthermore, our findings suggest that foodborne Gammaproteobacteria could be the major reservoir of food-associated AMR genetic determinants, and that the resistome structure of the selected high-risk food commodi-ties are, to a large extent, dictated by microbiome composition. Conclusions{\enspace} For metagenomic sequencing-based surveillance of AMR, the target-capture method presented herein represents a more sensitive and efficient approach to evaluate the resistome profile of complex food or environmen-tal samples. This study also further implicates retail foods as carriers of diverse resistance-conferring genes indicating a potential impact on the dissemination of AMR.},

Antimicrobials have important roles in beef production; however, the potential to introduce AMR to people through beef products is a concern. This scoping review identifies factors associated with changes in the prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant                 Enterococcus                 spp. applicable to the Canadian farm-to-fork beef continuum.                                                        Methods                                Five databases (MEDLINE, BIOSIS, Web of Science, Embase, and CAB Abstracts) were searched for articles published from January 1984 to March 2022, using                 a priori                 inclusion criteria. Peer-reviewed articles were included if they met all the following criteria: written in English, applicable to the Canadian beef production context, primary research,                 in vivo                 research, describing an intervention or exposure, and specific to                 Enterococcus                 spp.                                                        Results                                Out of 804 screened articles, 26 were selected for inclusion. The included articles discussed 37 factors potentially associated with AMR in enterococci, with multiple articles discussing at least two of the same factors.

Discussion               Comparability issues arising throughout the review process were related to data aggregation, hierarchical structures, study design, and inconsistent data reporting. Findings from articles were often temporally specific in that resistance was associated with AMR outcomes at sampling times closer to exposure compared to studies that sampled at longer intervals after exposure. Resistance was often nuanced to unique gene and phenotypic resistance patterns that varied with species of enterococci. Intrinsic resistance and interpretation of minimum inhibitory concentration varied greatly among enterococcal species, highlighting the importance of caution when comparing articles and generalizing findings.

  abstract = {We examined the ability of composting to remove ARGs and enteric bacteria in litter obtained from broiler chickens fed with a diet supplemented with Bacitracin methylene disalicylate (BDM) (conventional chicken litter), or an antibiotic-free diet (raised without antibiotic (RWA) chicken litter). This was done by evaluating the litter before and after composting for the abundance of ten gene targets associated with antibiotic resistance or horizontal gene transfer, the composition of the bacterial communities, and the abundance of viable enteric bacteria. The abundance of gene targets was determined by qPCR and the microbial community composition of chicken litter determined by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Enteric bacteria were enumerated by viable plate count. A majority of the gene targets were more abundant in conventional than in RWA litter. In both litter types, the absolute abundance of all of the target genes decreased after composting except sul1, intI1, incW and erm(F) that remained stable. Composting significantly reduced the abundance of enteric bacteria, including those carrying antibiotic resistance. The major difference in bacterial community composition between conventional and RWA litter was due to members affiliated to the genus Pseudomonas, which were 28\% more abundant in conventional than in RWA litter. Composting favoured the presence of thermophilic bacteria, such as those affiliated with the genus Truepera, but decreased the abundance of those bacterial genera associated with cold-adapted species, such as Carnobacterium, Psychrobacter and Oceanisphaera. The present study shows that chicken litter from broilers fed with a diet supplemented with antibiotic has an increased abundance of some ARGs, even after composting. However, we can conclude that fertilization with composted litter represents a reduced risk of transmission of antibiotic resistance genes and enteric bacteria of poultry origin to soil and crops than will fertilization with raw litter.},

  abstract = {Pathogenic spore-forming Firmicutes are commonly present in animal and human wastes that are used as fer\- tilizers in crop production. Pre-treatments of organic waste prior to land application offer the potential to abate enteric microorganisms, and therefore reduce the risk of contamination of crops or adjacent water resources with pathogens carried in these materials. The inactivation and reduction of gram-positive spore formers such as Clostridium spp., Clostridioides spp. and Bacillus spp. from animal and human waste can be challenging given the recalcitrance of the spores these bacteria produce. Given the significance of these organisms to human and animal health, information concerning spore-forming bacteria inactivation during anaerobic digestion (AD) and aerobic composting (AC) is required as the basis for recommending safe organic waste management practices. In this review, an assessment of the inactivation of spore-forming Firmicutes during AD and AC was conducted to provide guidance for practical management of organic matrices of animal or human origin. Temperature and pH may be the main factors contributing to the inactivation of spore-forming Firmicutes during batch lab-scale AD (log reduction {$<$}0.5--5 log). In continuous digesters, wet AD systems do not effectively inactivate spore-forming Firmicutes even under thermopholic conditions (log reduction - 1.09 -- 0.98), but dry AD systems could be a feasible management practice to inactivate spore-forming Firmicutes from organic materials with high solid content (log reduction 1.77--3.1). In contrast, composting is an effective treatment to abate spore-forming Fir\- micutes (log reduction 1.7--6.5) when thermophilic conditions last at least six consecutive days. Temperature, moisture content and composting scale are the key operating conditions influencing the inactivation of sporeforming Firmicutes during composting. Where possible, undertaking AD with subsequent composting to ensure the biosafety of digestate before its downstream processing and recycling is recommended to abate recalcitrant bacteria in digestate.},

  abstract = {Treatment of manures prior to land application can potentially reduce the abundance of antibiotic resistance genes and thus the risk of contaminating crops or water resources. In this study, raw and composted chicken litter were applied to field plots that were cropped to carrots, lettuce and radishes. Vegetables were washed per normal culinary practice before downstream analysis. The impact of composting on manure microbial composition, persistence of antibiotic resistant bacteria in soil following application, and distribution of antibiotic resistance genes and bacteria on washed vegetables were determined. A subset of samples that were thought likely to reveal the most significant effects were chosen for shotgun sequencing. The absolute abundance of all target genes detected by qPCR decreased after composting except sul1, intI1, incW and erm(F) that remained stable. The shotgun sequencing revealed that some integron integrases were enriched by composting. Composting significantly reduced the abundance of enteric bacteria, including those carrying antibiotic resistance. Manureamended soil showed significantly higher abundances of sul1, str(A), str(B), erm(B), aad(A), intI1 and incW compared to unmanured soil. At harvest, those genes that were detected in soil samples before the application of manure (intI1, sul1, strA and strB) were quantifiable by qPCR on vegetables, with a larger number of gene targets detected on the radishes than in the carrots or lettuce. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing suggested that the increase of antibiotic resistance genes on radishes produced in soil receiving raw manure may be due to changes to soil microbial communities following manure application, rather than transfer to the radishes of enteric bacteria. Overall, under field conditions there was limited evidence for transfer of antibiotic resistance genes from composted or raw manure to vegetables that then persisted through washing.},

In the present study, metagenomes available in the public domain from polluted (with antibiotics, with petroleum, with metal mining, or with coal-min\- ing effluents) and unpolluted terrestrial and aquatic environments were compared to examine whether pollution has influenced the abundance and composition of ARGs and mobile elements, with specific focus on IS26 and class 1 integrons (intI1). When aggregated together, polluted environments had a greater relative abundance of ARGs than unpolluted environments and a greater relative abundance of IS26 and intI1. In general, chemical pollution, notably with petroleum, was associated with an increase in the prevalence of ARGs linked to multidrug efflux pumps. Included in the suite of efflux pumps were mexK, mexB, mexF, and mexW that are polyspecific and whose substrate ranges include multiple classes of critically important antibiotics. Also, in some instances, {$\beta$}-lactam resistance (TEM181 and OXA-541) genes increased, and genes associated with rifampicin resistance (RNA polymerases subunits rpoB and rpoB2) decreased in relative abundance. This meta-analysis suggests that different types of chemical pollution can enrich populations that carry efflux pump systems associated with resistance to multiple classes of medically critical antibiotics.},

  abstract = {It is generally thought that antibiotics confer upon the producing bacteria the ability to inhibit or kill neighboring microorganisms, thereby providing the producer with a significant competitive advantage. Were this to be the case, the concentrations of emitted antibiotics in the vicinity of producing bacteria might be expected to fall within the ranges of MICs that are documented for a number of bacteria. Furthermore, antibiotic concentrations that bacteria are punctually or chronically exposed to in environments harboring antibiotic-producing bacteria might fall within the range of minimum selective concentrations (MSCs) that confer a fitness advantage to bacteria carrying acquired antibiotic resistance genes. There are, to our knowledge, no available in situ measured antibiotic concentrations in the biofilm environments that bacteria typically live in. The objective of the present study was to use a modeling approach to estimate the antibiotic concentrations that might accumulate in the vicinity of bacteria that are producing an antibiotic. Fick's law was used to model antibiotic diffusion using a series of key assumptions. The concentrations of antibiotics within a few microns of single producing cells could not reach MSC (8 to 16 mg/L) or MIC (500 mg/L) values, whereas the concentrations around aggregates of a thousand cells could reach these concentrations. The model outputs suggest that single cells could not produce an antibiotic at a rate sufficient to achieve a bioactive concentration in the vicinity, whereas a group of cells, each producing the antibiotic, could do so.},

The Enterobacteriaceae is currently considered as the most taxonomically diverse among all seven recognized families. The emergence of carbapenem resistance (CR) in Enterobacteriaceae caused by hydrolytic enzymes called carbapenemases has become a major concern worldwide. Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) isolates have been reported not only in nosocomial and community-acquired pathogens but also in food-producing animals, companion animals, and the environment. The reported carbapenemases in Enterobacteriaceae from different sources belong to the Ambler class A (blaKPC), class B (blaIMP, blaVIM, blaNDM), and class D (blaOXA-48) {$\beta$}-lactamases. The carbapenem encoding genes are often located on plasmids or associated with various mobile genetic elements (MGEs) like transposons and integrons, which contribute significantly to their spread. These genes are most of the time associated with other antimicrobial resistance genes such as other {$\beta$}-lactamases, as well as aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones resistance genes leading to multidrug resistance phenotypes. Control strategies to prevent infections due to CRE and their dissemination in human, animal and food have become necessary. Several factors involved in the emergence of CRE have been described. This review mainly focuses on the molecular epidemiology of carbapenemases in members of Enterobacteriaceae family from humans, animals, food and the environment.},

The STEC family of pathogens is biochemically diverse, and current microbiological methods for detecting STEC are limited by the lack of a universal selective enrichment approach and prone to interference by high levels of background microbiota associated with certain types of foods. A novel approach has been developed for the recovery of foodborne illness outbreak strains during outbreak investigations based on the analysis of whole genome sequence data of implicated clinical isolates to determine antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes. The presence of certain AMR genes in STEC has been correlated with the ability to grow in the presence of a specific antibiotic, which can be used to supplement enrichment broths to improve the recovery of a target strain. The enhanced recovery of STEC strains with different AMR profiles from various food types (beef, sprouts, leafy greens, and raw milk cheese) containing high levels of background microbiota was demonstrated using AMR predictions for nine different antibiotics. This genomically informed custom selective enrichment approach increases the availability of analytical options and improves the reliability of food microbiological analyses in confirming food vehicles implicated in outbreak events and defining the scope of product contamination to support risk assessment and risk management actions.},

Despite the ubiquity of methyltransferases and the immense variety of possible methylation patterns, epigenomic diversity remains unexplored for most bacterial species. Members of the               Bacteroides fragilis               group (BFG) reside in the human gastrointestinal tract as key players in symbiotic communities but also can establish anaerobic infections that are increasingly multi-drug resistant.

Our analysis reveals that single BFG species harbor hundreds of DNA methylation motifs, with most individual motif combinations occurring uniquely in single isolates, implying immense unsampled methylation diversity within BFG epigenomes. Mining of BFG genomes identified more than 6000 methyltransferase genes, approximately 1000 of which were associated with intact prophages. Network analysis revealed substantial gene flow among disparate phage genomes, implying a role for genetic exchange between BFG phages as one of the ultimate sources driving BFG epigenome diversity.},

Samples of raw and digested manure were obtained from six commercial dairy farms in Ontario, Canada. Digestion significantly abated populations of viable coliforms in all six farms. Conjugative transfer of plasmids carrying b-lactamase genes from manure bacteria enriched overnight with buffered peptone containing 4 mg/liter cefotaxime into a b-lactam-sensitive green fluorescent protein (GFP)-labeled Escherichia coli recipient strain was evaluated in patch matings. Digestion significantly decreased the frequency of the horizontal transfer of ESBL genes. Twenty-five transconjugants were sequenced, revealing six distinct plasmids, ranging in size from 40 to 180 kb. A variety of ESBL genes were identified: blaCTX-M-1, blaCTX-M-14, blaCTX-M-15, blaCTX-M-27, blaCTX-M-55, and blaPER-1. blaCTX-M-15 was the most prevalent ESBL gene detected on plasmids harbored by transconjugants. Various mobile genetic elements were found located proximal to resistance genes. Ten gene targets, including sul1, str(A), str(B), erm(B), erm(F), intI1, aadA, incW, blaPSE, and blaOXA-20, were quantified by quantitative PCR on a subset of 18 raw and 18 digested samples. Most targets were significantly more abundant in raw manure; however, erm(B) and erm(F) targets were more abundant in digested samples.

The Chicken Farmers of Canada have developed and are implementing an Antimicrobial Use Reduction Strategy, which has the ultimate goal of eliminating the preventive use of medically important antibiotics in broiler chicken and turkey production. However, very little is known about the real overall impact of an antibiotic use reduction strategy in complex ecosystems, such as the bird intestine or the commercial broiler chicken farm. The main objectives of the present study were to compare the abundance of antibiotic resistance-encoding genes, characterize the intestinal microbiota composition, and evaluate the presence of Clostridium perfringens, in six commercial poultry farms adopting short-term antibiotic withdrawal and long-term judicious use strategy. Implementing an antibiotic-free program over a 15-months period did not reduce the abundance of many antibiotic resistance-encoding genes, whereas the judicious use of antibiotics over 6 years was found effective. The short-term antibiotic withdrawal and the long-term judicious use strategy altered the intestinal microbiota composition, with the Ruminococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae families being negatively impacted. These findings are in agreement with the lower production performance and with the increased C. perfringens populations observed for farms phasing out the use of antibiotics. Adopting a conventional rearing program on commercial broiler chicken farms selected for specific antibiotic resistance-encoding genes in many barns. This study highlights the potential impacts of different rearing programs in poultry production and will help guide future policies in order to reduce the use of antibiotics while maintaining production performance.},

Central to this exchange are mobile genetic elements like plasmids; yet, the factors shaping their presence in agricultural environments remain poorly understood. Here, using Escherichia coli as a model bacterium, we examined genetic backgrounds and plasmid profiles of generic fecal and wastewater isolates and those possessing blaCTX-M and blaCMY-2 genes (which confer resistance to third-generation cephalosporins) to delineate factors shaping the environmental persistence of plasmid-associated ARGs in beef cattle feedlots. The wastewater environment exerted minimal influence on plasmid repertoires, as the number of plasmids and distribution of different incompatibility groups did not differ between generic fecal and wastewater isolates. The blaCTX-M and blaCMY-2 genes were associated with IncF and IncA/C plasmids, respectively, and host isolates possessing these ARGs had fewer plasmids than generic isolates, suggesting ARG-bearing plasmids may associate predominantly with such hosts to compensate for the metabolic burden imposed by these plasmids. Phylogeny also appeared to be a factor for blaCTX-M genes, as their bacterial hosts were restricted to particular genetic lineages, including the environmentally adapted ET-1 clade, as noted previously for these genes. Ultimately, these findings have important implications for evaluating human health risks of agricultural wastewater with respect to environmental persistence of ARGs and may help identify options for improving wastewater treatment.},

  abstract = {Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is a disease leading to spontaneous abortions and stillbirths in sows and lowered life quality and expectancy in growing pigs. PRRS is prevalent worldwide and has significant economic impacts to swine industries around the globe. Co-expression of the two most abundant proteins in the viral envelope, the matrix protein (M) and glycosylated protein 5 (GP5), can produce a neutralizing immune response for the virus providing a potentially effective subunit vaccine against the disease, but these proteins are difficult to express. The goal of this research was to display antigenic portions of the M and GP5 proteins on the surface of tobacco mosaic virus-like particles. A modified tobacco mosaic virus coat protein (TMVc) was transiently expressed in               Nicotiana benthamiana               leaves and targeted to three subcellular compartments along the secretory pathway to introduce glycosylation patterns important for M-GP5 epitope immunogenicity. We found that accumulation levels in the apoplast were similar to the ER and the vacuole. Because glycans present on plant apoplastic proteins are closest to those present on PRRSV proteins, a TMVc-M-GP5 fusion construct was targeted to the apoplast and accumulated at over 0.5 mg/g of plant fresh weight. TMVc virus-like particles self-assembled in plant cells and surface-displayed the M-GP5 epitope, as visualized by transmission electron microscopy and immunogold localization. These promising findings lay the foundation for immunogenicity and protective-immunity studies in animals to examine the efficacy of this vaccine candidate as a measure to control PRRS.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            The sulfonamides (sulfas) are the oldest class of antibacterial drugs and inhibit the bacterial dihydropteroate synthase (DHPS, encoded by               folP               ), through chemical mimicry of its co-substrate               p               -aminobenzoic acid (               p               ABA). Resistance to sulfa drugs is mediated either by mutations in               folP               or acquisition of               sul               genes, which code for sulfa-insensitive, divergent DHPS enzymes. While the molecular basis of resistance through               folP               mutations is well understood, the mechanisms mediating               sul               -based resistance have not been investigated in detail. Here, we determine crystal structures of the most common Sul enzyme types (Sul1, Sul2 and Sul3) in multiple ligand-bound states, revealing a substantial reorganization of their               p               ABA-interaction region relative to the corresponding region of DHPS. We use biochemical and biophysical assays, mutational analysis, and in trans complementation of               E. coli               {$\Delta$}               folP               to show that a Phe-Gly sequence enables the Sul enzymes to discriminate against sulfas while retaining               p               ABA binding and is necessary for broad resistance to sulfonamides. Experimental evolution of               E. coli               results in a strain harboring a sulfa-resistant DHPS variant that carries a Phe-Gly insertion in its active site, recapitulating this molecular mechanism. We also show that Sul enzymes possess increased active site conformational dynamics relative to DHPS, which could contribute to substrate discrimination. Our results reveal the molecular foundation for Sul-mediated drug resistance and facilitate the potential development of new sulfas less prone to resistance.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT Cranberry and blueberry pomaces are rich in antimicrobial and antioxidant compounds. They have been identified as potential antibiotic alternatives in animal feed, but their antioxidative capacity for maintaining or improving the meat quality in broilers is not well documented. This study was to determine whether cranberry and wild blueberry pomaces in diets could positively influence the broiler meat quality. A total of 3,150 broilers were randomly allotted to 10 dietary treatments with bacitracin methylene disalicylate, wild cranberry pomace (CRP) (0.5 and 1\% of the basal diet), and wild blueberry pomace (BLP) (0.5 and 1\% of the basal diet) alone or in combination with a mixture of feed enzymes. The results showed that supplementation with the CRP or BLP did not affect meat lightness and yellowness, while the deeper red meat (higher a* values) was observed in the birds receiving the diet containing 0.5\% BLP against those in CRP treatments (P 5 0.015). In addition, inclusion of CRP or BLP in the diet did not change meat texture and proximate composition (moisture, protein, fat, ash) irrespective of pomace concentrations. Although there were no obvious effects of CRP or BLP supplementation on meat antioxidant capacity and the incidence of myopathies (P . 0.05), the upward trend of antioxidant capacity and less severity of woody breast were observed in birds fed with 0.5\% CRP. Furthermore, supplementation of 0.5 or 1.0\% CRP without the enzyme resulted in higher mRNA levers of Nrf, Gpx2, and HO-1 (P , 0.05). Taken together, 0.5\% CRP supplementation without the enzyme could potentially maintain meat quality and attenuate the severity of woody breast.},

The five dietary treatments including the basal diet (negative control [NC]) and the basal diet supplemented with 55 ppm of bacitracin (BAC), 100 ppm of encapsulated CIN, 100 ppm of encapsulated CIT, or 100 ppm each of encapsulated CIN and encapsulated CIT (CIN{\th}CIT). Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of 240 E. coli isolates revealed that the most common resistance was to {$\beta$}-lactams, aminoglycosides, sulfonamides, and tetracycline; however, the prevalence of AMR decreased (P , 0.05) as birds aged. The prevalence of resistance to amoxicillin--clavulanic acid, ceftiofur, ceftriaxone, cefoxitin, gentamicin, and sulfonamide was lower (P , 0.05) in isolates from the CIN or CIN{\th}CIT groups than in isolates from the NC or BAC groups. Whole genome sequencing of 227 of the 240 isolates revealed 26 AMR genes and 19 plasmids, but the prevalence of some AMR genes and the number of plasmids were lower (P , 0.05) in E. coli isolated from CIN or CIN{\th}CIT birds than in isolates from NC or BAC birds. The most prevalent resistance genes were tet(A) (108 isolates), aac(3)-VIa (91 isolates), aadA1 (86 isolates), blaCMY-2 (78 isolates), sul1 (77 isolates), aph(3)-Ib (58 isolates), aph(6)-Id (58 isolates), and sul2 (24 isolates). The numbers of most virulence genes carried by isolates increased (P , 0.05) in chickens from 6 to 27 days of age. The prevalence of E. coli O21:H16 isolates was lower (P , 0.05) in CIN and CIN{\th}CIT, and the colibacillosis-associated multilocus sequence type (ST117) was most prevalent in isolates from 23-day-old chickens. A phylogenetic tree of whole genome sequences revealed a close relationship between 25 of the 227 isolates and human or broiler extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli strains. These findings indicate that AMR and virulence genotypes of E. coli could be modulated by providing encapsulated CIN or CIN{\th}CIT feed supplements, but further investigation is needed to determine the mechanisms of the effects of these supplements.},

Vaccinated (1,600) and nonvaccinated (1,600) 0-day-old male Cobb500 broilers were randomly allocated to 5 treatments: basal diet (control) and basal diet supplemented with bacitracin (BAC, 55 ppm), CIN (100 ppm), CIT (100 ppm), and CIN (100 ppm) 1 CIT (100 ppm). In general, body weight (BW) and feed conversion ratio were significantly improved in birds treated with BAC, CIN, CIT, and CIN 1 CIT (P , 0.05) but were all decreased in vaccinated birds compared with nonvaccinated birds (P , 0.05). Significant interactions (P , 0.05) between vaccination and treatments for average daily gain during the periods of starter (day 0--9) and BW on day 10 were noted. Broilers receiving vaccines (P , 0.01) or feed supplemented with BAC, CIN, CIT, or CIN 1 CIT (P , 0.01) showed reductions in mortality rate from day 0 to 28. The incidences of minor coccidiosis were higher (P , 0.05) in vaccinated birds than in nonvaccinated birds. Diet supplementation with BAC or tested encapsulated essential oils showed comparable effects on the coccidiosis incidences. Similar to BAC, CIN and its combination with CIT reduced both incidence and severity of necrotic enteritis (P , 0.05). No treatment effects were observed on the cecal microbiota at the phyla level. At the genus level, significant differences between vaccination and treatment groups were observed for 5 (Lactobacillus, Ruminococcus, Faecalibacterium, Enterococcus, and Clostridium) of 40 detected genera (P , 0.05). The genus Lactobacillus was more abundant in broilers fed with CIT, while Clostridium and Enterococcus were less abundant in broilers fed with CIN, CIT, or CIN 1 CIT in both the vaccinated and nonvaccinated groups. Results from this study suggested that CIN alone or in combination with CIT in feed could improve chicken growth performance to the level comparable with BAC and alter cecal microbiota composition.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Essential oils are potential antimicrobial alternatives and their applications in animal feeds are limited due to their fast absorption in the upper gastrointestinal tract. This study investigated the effects of encapsulated cinnamaldehyde (CIN) at 50 mg/kg or 100 mg/kg on the growth performance, organ weights, meat quality, intestinal morphology, jejunal gene expression, nutrient digestibility, and ileal and cecal microbiota. A total of 320 male day-old broiler Cobb-500 chicks were randomly allocated to four treatments with eight pens per treatment (10 birds per pen): 1) basal diet (negative control, NC); 2) basal diet supplemented with 30 mg/kg avilamycin premix (positive control, PC); 3) basal diet with 50 mg/kg encapsulated CIN (EOL); 4) basal diet with 100 mg/kg encapsulated CIN (EOH). Despite birds fed EOH tended to increase (P = 0.05) meat pH at 24 h, all pH values were normal. Similar to PC group, meats from birds fed EOL and EOH showed a reduced (P \&lt; 0.05) Warner--Bratzler force shear (WBFS) compared to the NC group. The highest villus to crypt ratios (VH/CD; P \&lt; 0.05) were observed in broilers fed either EOL or EOH, with an average of 14.67\% and 15.13\% in the duodenum and 15.13\% and 13.58\% in the jejunum, respectively. For jejunal gene expressions, only six out of the 11 studied genes showed statistically significant differences among the dietary treatments. Gene expressions of cationic amino acid transporter 1 (CAT-1) and neutral amino acid transporter 1 (B0AT-1) were upregulated in EOH-fed birds compared to PC and NC-fed birds (P \&lt; 0.05), respectively; while the expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) was downregulated in EOL-fed birds when compared to NC birds (P \&lt; 0.05). Nonetheless, the expressions of cadherin 1 (CDH-1), zonula occludens 1 (ZO-1), and maltase-glucoamylase (MG) were all upregulated (P \&lt; 0.05) in EOH-fed birds compared to PC-fed birds. The apparent ileal digestibility (AID) of dry matter, crude protein, crude fat and of all 18 tested amino acids increased in EOL-fed birds (P \&lt; 0.01). Additionally, relative abundances (\%) of ileal Proteobacteria decreased, while ileal and cecal Lactobacillus increased in EOH-fed birds (P \&lt; 0.05). In conclusion, dietary encapsulated CIN improved meat quality and gut health by reducing meat WBFS, increasing VH/CD in intestines, jejunal gene expressions, AID of nutrients and beneficial ileal and cecal microbiota composition.},

This study investigated the cecal microbiome of broiler-vaccinated or non-vaccinated birds against coccidiosis. Birds in each of the two groups (vaccinated or non-vaccinated) were fed a basal nonsupplemented diet (NC), a basal diet supplemented with bacitracin (BAC), American cranberry (CP), and lowbush blueberry (BP) pomace alone or in combination (CP + BP). At 21 days of age, cecal DNA samples were extracted and analyzed using both whole-metagenome shotgun sequencing and targeted-resistome sequencing approaches. Ceca from vaccinated birds showed a lower abundance of Lactobacillus and a higher abundance of Escherichia coli than non-vaccinated birds (p {$<$} 0.05). The highest and lowest abundance of L. crispatus and E. coli, respectively, were observed in birds fed CP, BP, and CP + BP compared to those from NC or BAC treatments (p {$<$} 0.05). Coccidiosis vaccination affected the abundance of virulence genes (VGs) related to adherence, flagella, iron utilization, and secretion system. Toxin-related genes were observed in vaccinated birds (p {$<$} 0.05) in general, with less prevalence in birds fed CP, BP, and CP + BP than NC and BAC (p {$<$} 0.05). More than 75 antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) detected by the shotgun metagenomics sequencing were impacted by vaccination. Ceca from birds fed CP, BP, and CP + BP showed the lowest (p {$<$} 0.05) abundances of ARGs related to multi-drug efflux pumps, modifying/hydrolyzing enzyme and target-mediated mutation, when compared to ceca from birds fed BAC. Targeted metagenomics showed that resistome from BP treatment was distant to other groups for antimicrobials, such as aminoglycosides (p {$<$} 0.05). Significant differences in the richness were observed between the vaccinated and non-vaccinated groups for aminoglycosides, {$\beta$}-lactams, lincosamides, and trimethoprim resistance genes (p {$<$} 0.05). Overall, this study demonstrated that dietary berry pomaces and coccidiosis vaccination significantly impacted cecal microbiota, virulome, resistome, and metabolic pathways in broiler chickens.},

These ExPEC strains could contaminate the environment and/or food chain representing thus, food safety and human health risk. However, few studies have shown the virulence of poultry-source antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) ExPEC in humans. This study characterized AMR ExPEC and investigated the virulence potential of some of their isolates in a Caenorhabditis elegans infection model. A total of 46 E. coli isolates from poultry (chicken, n = 29; turkey, n = 12) retail meats and chicken feces (n = 4), or humans (n = 1) were sequenced and identified as ExPEC. Except eight, all remaining 38 ExPEC isolates were resistant to at least one antibiotic and carried corresponding antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs). About 27 of the 46 ExPEC isolates were multidrug-resistant ({$\geq$}3 antibiotic classes). Seven ExPEC isolates from chicken or turkey meats were of serotype O25:H4 and sequence type (ST) 131 which clustered with an isolate from a human urinary tract infection (UTI) case having the same serotype and ST. The C. elegans challenge model using eight of studied ExPEC isolates harboring various ARGs and virulence genes (VGs) showed that regardless of their ARG or VG numbers in tested poultry meat and feces, ExPEC significantly reduced the life span of the nematode (P {$<$} 0.05) similarly to a human UTI isolate. This study indicated the pathogenic potential of AMR ExPEC from retail poultry meat or feces, but more studies are warranted to establish their virulence in poultry and human. Furthermore, relationships between specific resistance profiles and/or VGs in these E. coli isolates for their pathogenicity deserve investigations.},

Several elements of a risk profile may benefit from a scoping review (ScR). To contribute to a larger risk profile structured according to the Codex Guidelines, our objective was to conduct a ScR of the current state of knowledge on the distribution, frequency and concentrations of extended-spectrum {$\beta$}-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae in salmon and shrimp. Articles were identified via a comprehensive search of five bibliographic databases. Two reviewers screened titles and abstracts for relevance and characterised full-text articles with screening forms developed a priori. Sixteen relevant studies were identified. This review found that there is a lack of Canadian data regarding ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae in salmon and shrimp. However, ESBL- producing Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and other Enterobacteriaceae have been isolated in multiple regions with a history of exporting seafood to Canada. The literature described herein will support future decision-making on this issue as research/ surveillance and subsequent assessments are currently lacking.},

  abstract = {Background: Comparative knowledge of microbiomes and resistomes across environmental interfaces between animal production systems and urban settings is lacking. In this study, we executed a comparative analysis of the microbiota and resistomes of metagenomes from cattle feces, catch basin water, manured agricultural soil and urban sewage. Results: Metagenomic DNA from composite fecal samples (FC; n = 12) collected from penned cattle at four feedlots in Alberta, Canada, along with water from adjacent catchment basins (CB; n = 13), soil (n = 4) from fields in the vicinity of one of the feedlots and urban sewage influent (SI; n = 6) from two municipalities were subjected to Illumina HiSeq2000 sequencing. Firmicutes exhibited the highest prevalence (40\%) in FC, whereas Proteobacteria were most abundant in CB (64\%), soil (60\%) and SI (83\%). Among sample types, SI had the highest diversity of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), and metal and biocide resistance (MBR) classes (13 \& 15) followed by FC (10 \& 8), CB (8 \& 4), and soil (6 \& 1). The highest antimicrobial resistant (AMR) gene (ARG) abundance was harboured by FC, whereas soil samples had a very small, but unique resistome which did not overlap with FC \& CB resistomes. In the beef production system, tetracycline resistance predominated followed by macrolide resistance. The SI resistome harboured {$\beta$}-lactam, macrolide, tetracycline, aminoglycoside, fluoroquinolone and fosfomycin resistance determinants. Metal and biocide resistance accounted for 26\% of the SI resistome with a predominance of mercury resistance. Conclusions: This study demonstrates an increasing divergence in the nature of the microbiome and resistome as the distance from the feedlot increases. Consistent with antimicrobial use, tetracycline and macrolide resistance genes were predominant in the beef production system. One of the feedlots contributed both conventional (raised with antibiotics) and natural (raised without antibiotics) pens samples. Although natural pen samples exhibited a microbiota composition that was similar to samples from conventional pens, their resistome was less complex. Similarly, the SI resistome was indicative of drug classes used in humans and the greater abundance of mercury resistance may be associated with contamination of municipal water with household and industrial products.},

Species identification of               Enterococcus               revealed distinct associations across the continuum. Of the 8430 isolates collected,               Enterococcus faecium               and               Enterococcus faecalis               were the main species in urban wastewater (90\%) and clinical human isolates (99\%);               Enterococcus hirae               predominated in cattle (92\%) and feedlot catch-basins (60\%), whereas natural streams harbored environmental               Enterococcus               spp. Whole-genome sequencing of               E. faecalis               (n\,=\,366 isolates) and               E. faecium               (n\,=\,342 isolates), revealed source clustering of isolates, indicative of distinct adaptation to their respective environments. Phenotypic resistance to tetracyclines and macrolides encoded by               tet(M)               and               erm(B)               respectively, was prevalent among               Enterococcus               spp. regardless of source. For               E. faecium               from cattle, resistance to {$\beta$}-lactams and quinolones was observed among 3\% and 8\% of isolates respectively, compared to 76\% and 70\% of human clinical isolates. Clinical vancomycin-resistant               E. faecium               exhibited high rates of multi-drug resistance, with resistance to all {$\beta$}-lactam, macrolides, and quinolones tested. Differences in the AMR profiles among isolates reflected antimicrobial use practices in each sector of the One-Health continuum.},

  abstract = {Enterococci are Gram-positive bacteria that can be isolated from a variety of environments including soil, water, plants, and the intestinal tract of humans and animals. Although they are considered commensals in humans, Enterococcus spp. are important opportunistic pathogens. Due to their presence and persistence in diverse environments, Enterococcus spp. are ideal for studying antimicrobial resistance (AMR) from the One Health perspective. We undertook a comparative genomic analysis of the virulome, resistome, mobilome, and the association between the resistome and mobilome of 246 E. faecium and 376 E. faecalis recovered from livestock (swine, beef cattle, poultry, dairy cattle), human clinical samples, municipal wastewater, and environmental sources. Comparative genomics of E. faecium and E. faecalis identified 31 and 34 different antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs), with 62\% and 68\% of the isolates having plasmid-associated ARGs, respectively. Across the One Health continuum, tetracycline (tetL and tetM) and macrolide resistance (ermB) were commonly identified in E. faecium and E. faecalis. These ARGs were frequently associated with mobile genetic elements along with other ARGs conferring resistance against aminoglycosides [ant(6)-la, aph(3 )-IIIa], lincosamides [lnuG, lsaE], and streptogramins (sat4). Study of the core E. faecium genome identified two main clades, clade `A' and `B', with clade A isolates primarily originating from humans and municipal wastewater and carrying more virulence genes and ARGs related to category I antimicrobials. Overall, despite differences in antimicrobial usage across the continuum, tetracycline and macrolide resistance genes persisted in all sectors.},

  abstract = {Carbapenems are considered a last resort for the treatment of multi-drug-resistant bacterial infections in humans. In this study, we investigated the occurrence of carbapenem-resistant bacteria in feedlots in Alberta, Canada. The presumptive carbapenem-resistant isolates (n = 116) recovered after ertapenem enrichment were subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility testing against 12 different antibiotics, including four carbapenems. Of these, 72\% of the isolates (n = 84) showed resistance to ertapenem, while 27\% of the isolates (n = 31) were resistant to at least one other carbapenem, with all except one isolate being resistant to at least two other drug classes. Of these 31 isolates, 90\% were carbapenemase positive, while a subset of 36 ertapenem-only resistant isolates were carbapenemase negative. The positive isolates belonged to three genera; Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, and Stenotrophomonas, with the majority being Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 20) as identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Whole genome sequencing identified intrinsic carbapenem resistance genes, including blaOXA-50 and its variants (P. aeruginosa), blaOXA-265 (A. haemolyticus), blaOXA-648 (A. lwoffii), blaOXA-278 (A. junii), and blaL1 and blaL2 (S. maltophilia). The acquired carbapenem resistance gene (blaPST-2) was identified in P. saudiphocaensis and P. stutzeri. In a comparative genomic analysis, clinical P. aeruginosa clustered separately from those recovered from bovine feces. In conclusion, despite the use of selective enrichment methods, finding carbapenem-resistant bacteria within a feedlot environment was a rarity.},

Peracetic acid (13.67 mM), a conventional chemical commonly used in the poultry industry, was used as a positive control to compare efficacy. The chicken legs were sprayed with anti\- microbial solutions and aerobically stored at 4 {\textopenbullet}C for 10 days. The RL treatment maintained the total viable count below the limit of 7 log CFU/g until the 8th day. Therefore, compared to the nontreated group, shelf-life was extended by 3 days in the RL treated group. The RJ treatment extended the shelf-life to 7 days, which is similar to what was achieved with the use of peracetic acid. Based on culture-independent amplicon sequencing, the RL and RJ treatments affected the microbial community on the chicken legs, inducing a delay in the increase of Pseu\- domonas, Psychrobacter and Carnobacterium while decreasing of Shigella. Significant decreases in sensory scores occurred in the nontreated group, while slight changes occurred in the combinations treated groups over the same period. Overall, sensory property scores for chicken legs treated with RL and RJ remained higher (P {$<$} 0.05) than those treated with peracetic acid or without antimicrobial agents. The antimicrobial combinations delayed the deterioration of sensory attributes throughout the storage period. These results suggest that RL and RJ provide a promising natural-sourced antimicrobial approach to control the growth of spoilage microorganisms on chicken legs.},

  abstract = {Background: Since the overuse of antibiotics in animal production has led to a selection of antibiotic-resistant pathogens that affect humans and animals as well. Scientists are therefore searching for novel natural alternatives to antibiotics. In this study Lactobacillus reuteri and a combination of reuterin and microcin J25 (RJ) were evaluated as promoters of growth and modulators of the cecal microbiota and metabolite profiles in broiler chickens. Oneday-old Cobb 500 male broilers were distributed to 8 treatments: negative control (without antibiotic), positive control (bacitracin), three concentrations of RJ and three doses of L. reuteri plus glycerol. The birds (2176, 34 per pen, 8 pens per treatment) were reared for 35 d. Results: The body weight of the bacitracin and 5 mmol/L reuterin combined with 0.08 {$\mu$}mol/L microcin J25 (10RJ) treatment group was significantly higher than that of the negative control group (P {$<$} 0.05). L. reuteri had no significant effect on broiler growth. MiSeq high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA showed clustering of cecal microbial operational taxonomic unit diversity according to treatment. The influence of bacitracin and 10RJ on bacterial community overall structure was similar. They promoted Ruminococcaceae, Lachnospiraceae and Lactobacillaceae, increased the relative abundance of Faecalibacterium and decreased the abundance of Bacteroides and Alistipes, while the negative control condition favored Bacteroidaceae and Rikenellaceae. Furthermore, 10RJ increased the concentration of short-chain fatty acid in the cecum and changed the metabolome overall. Conclusions: These overall suggest that 10RJ can promote a host-friendly gut environment by changing the cecal microbiome and metabolome. This combination of natural antimicrobial agents in the drinking water had a positive effect on broiler growth and may be suitable as an alternative to antibiotic growth promoters.},

We evaluated the efficacy of mixtures of natural antimicrobial compounds, namely reuterin, microcin J25, and lactic acid, for reducing the viability of Salmonella enterica and total aerobes on broiler chicken carcasses. The compounds were compared singly and in combination with water and 0.1\% peracetic acid. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of reuterin, lactic acid, and microcin J25 against S. enterica serovar Enteritidis were respectively 2 mM, 0.31\%, and 0.03 {$\mu$}M. In vitro, the combinations of reuterin + lactic acid and reuterin + microcin J25 were synergic, making these compounds effective at four times lower concentrations than those used alone. Salmonella viable counts fell to zero within 10 min of contact with reuterin + lactic acid at 10 times the concentrations used in combination, compared to 18 h in the case of reuterin + microcin J25. Sprayed onto chilled chicken carcasses, this reuterin + lactic acid mixture reduced Salmonella spp. counts by 2.02 Log CFU/g, whereas reuterin + microcin J25 and peracetic acid reduced them by respectively 0.83 and 1.13 Log CFU/g. The synergy of reuterin with lactic acid or microcin J25 as inhibitors of bacterial growth was significant. Applied as post-chill spray, these mixtures could contribute to food safety by decreasing Salmonella counts on chicken carcasses.},

However, not all ARGs pose serious threats to public health, highlighting the importance of identifying those that are high-risk. Here, we developed an `omics-based' framework to evaluate ARG risk considering human-associated-enrichment, gene mobility, and host pathogenicity. Our framework classifies human-associated, mobile ARGs (3.6\% of all ARGs) as the highest risk, which we further differentiate as `current threats' (Rank I; 3\%) - already present among pathogens - and `future threats' (Rank II; 0.6\%) - novel resistance emerging from non-pathogens. Our framework identified 73 `current threat' ARG families. Of these, 35 were among the 37 high-risk ARGs proposed by the World Health Organization and other literature; the remaining 38 were significantly enriched in hospital plasmids. By evaluating all pathogen genomes released since framework construction, we confirmed that ARGs that recently transferred into pathogens were significantly enriched in Rank II (`future threats'). Lastly, we applied the framework to gut microbiome genomes from fecal microbiota transplantation donors. We found that although ARGs were widespread (73\% of genomes), only 8.9\% of genomes contained high-risk ARGs. Our framework provides an easy-to-implement approach to identify current and future antimicrobial resistance threats, with potential clinical applications including reducing risk of microbiome-based interventions.},

Of the 13 non-O157 STEC isolates, two virulence genes of stx1a and hlyA were found in four (30.8\%) O91:H14 STEC isolates, whereas one virulence gene of stx2e, stx1a, and stx2a was identified in five (38.5\%), two (15.4\%), and one (7.7\%) STEC isolates, respectively, of various serotypes. The remaining non-O157 STEC isolate carried stx2, but the subtype is unknown because this isolate could not be recovered for sequencing. O91:H14 STEC (stx1a, hlyA) was previously reported in association with diarrheal illnesses, whereas the other non-O157 STEC isolates identified in this study are not known to be associated with severe human illnesses. Virulence gene profiles identified in this study indicate that the occurrence of non-O157 STEC capable of causing severe human illness is rare in Canadian retail pork. However, O157 STEC in ground pork can occasionally occur; therefore, education regarding the potential risks associated with STEC contamination of pork would be beneficial for the public and those in the food industry to help reduce foodborne illnesses.},
