## Maintain 

Brennan Chapman ([@chapb](https://github.com/chapb)) is the current maintainer of GRAPL.

The maintainer must:

- become the default assignee for issues defined in [issue templates](https://github.com/grdi-amr/publications/tree/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE) so they are promptly notified of group membership and submission requests. 
- be in control of the external submission form and be promptly notified of new submission requests.
- be an administrator of the Zotero Group Library so they can act on requests.
- respond to requests promptly.

At present, the form is owned by @chapb's phachapman account, and notifications occur via IFTTT.
